    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[DES MOINES, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA -- AUGUST 7, 2022: Shir Agha Safi, 30, takes a moment to relax at a park near Des Moines, Iowa, Sunday, Aug. 7, 2022. Safi, an Afghan military commander who used to lead men into battle against insurgent and terrorists in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, is now a refugee who arrived in Iowa wanting to disassociate from the trauma and burden of war. But soon enough as the influx of Afghan refugees increased, Safi was joined by other Afghan refugees in the motel that he was initially living in. One day an Afghan man tried crossing the road but did not know the traffic laws and was killed by a passing car. Safi realized that he needed to do something and has since started a non-profit organization called Afghan Partners in Iowa, that aims to train Afghan refugees who speak English to help fellow Afghans refugees with their needs and challenges. Like a commander in the battlefield previously, Safi is now leading his fellow Afghan to rebuild new lives in the United States. (MARCUS YAM / LOS ANGELES TIMES)]]></media:description>

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[Huntington Beach, CA - October 04: An aerial view of the patterns of oil pollution at Huntington State Beach in Huntington Beach Monday, Oct. 4, 2021. Cleanup crews began cleaning up the damage from a major oil spill off the Orange County coast that left crude spoiling beaches, killing fish and birds and threatening local wetlands. The oil slick is believed to have originated from a pipeline leak, pouring 126,000 gallons into the coastal waters and seeping into the Talbert Marsh as lifeguards deployed floating barriers known as booms to try to stop further incursion, said Jennifer Carey, Huntington Beach city spokesperson. At sunrise Sunday, oil was on the sand in some parts of Huntington Beach with slicks visible in the ocean as well. "We classify this as a major spill, and it is a high priority to us to mitigate any environmental concerns," Carey said. "It's all hands on deck." (Allen J.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[Anaheim, CA - August 24: Angels fans Jason Fry and wife Natsumi Fry, of Orange, take photos with their dog Benny, in front of Angel Stadium as the Angels play the Tampa Bay Rays away in Tampa Bay Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2022. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) For Angels loyalists, the team is a source of Orange County pride, even when they're losing. The family-friendly stadium, rally monkey mascot and mostly well-mannered fans are a stark contrast to the rival Dodgers in Los Angeles, fans say - and they like that. While fans don't care much for the team's owner, they are notoriously loyal to the franchise itself. The fan base was built over a 60-year period, and the really hardcore fans still look at the team to some degree as the "cowboy's team" led by Gene Autry. Being overshadowed by the Dodgers only adds to their distinct sense of identity, as do marquee stars like Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani who dazzle amid losing seasons.]]></media:description>
