        <![CDATA[<img src="https://static.politico.com/d9/39/bfe90c2642d9aa158f0500d0396a/trump-fbi-53866.jpg"> <br> <p>Donald Trump’s attorneys late Friday made a new pitch for an independent review of the materials seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate.</p> <p>In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.618763/gov.uscourts.flsd.618763.28.0.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;12-page filing&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.618763/gov.uscourts.flsd.618763.28.0.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9040006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9040007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">12-page filing</a>, they urged a federal judge to appoint a “special master” to prevent the Justice Department from continuing to comb through dozens of boxes taken by FBI agents earlier this month.</p> <p>The filing, which was billed as a “supplement” to Trump’s meandering initial bid on Monday, was notable, however, for what it didn’t include. It makes no mention of the hundreds of pages of classified documents recovered during the Aug. 8 search and in previous visits by investigators. It also makes no mention of Trump’s claims to have declassified the material. It also eschews the heated criticism Trump has leveled at Bruce Reinhart, the magistrate judge who authorized the search.</p> <p>Instead, Trump lawyers suggest in the filing that the search may have been improper or even illegal because of indications that investigators were concerned that records covered by the Presidential Records Act were at his Palm Beach home.</p> <p>“This provides the deeply troubling prospect that President Trump’s home was raided under a pretense of a suspicion that Presidential records were on his property — even though the Presidential Records Act is not a criminally-enforceable statute,” Trump’s filing said.</p> <p>Trump’s lawyers favorably cited <a href="https://casetext.com/case/armstrong-v-bush-4" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a D.C. appeals court’s 1991 ruling&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://casetext.com/case/armstrong-v-bush-4&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9040008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9040009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a D.C. appeals court’s 1991 ruling</a> in a dispute over electronic messages exchanged during the end of President Ronald Reagan’s second term, which held that while a sitting president has “virtually complete control” over his records, he must notify the Archivist before disposing of records. The ruling notes that “neither the Archivist nor the Congress has the authority to veto the President's disposal decision."</p> <p>But there are complications with the Trump team’s argument. The 1991 ruling did not discuss criminal enforcement of the Presidential Records Act or address the actions of former presidents. Moreover, that law was not cited as one of the criminal statutes used to justify the Mar-a-Lago search warrant. The three-decade-old D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision also offered no view on whether retaining White House records without authority might violate one of the laws the FBI and prosecutors did cite as the basis for the warrant: a broad prohibition on stealing, misusing or concealing government records.</p> <p>In addition to that law, investigators cited two other potential crimes at issue: willful retention of national defense information and obstruction of justice</p> <p>The late-night Friday filing was a coda to a frantic week for the former president’s legal team, which found itself struggling with basic administrative requirements and facing pointed questions from a Fort Pierce, Fla.-based federal judge, Aileen Cannon, about what precisely they were asking her to do.</p> <p>Among the questions Cannon has asked Trump’s lawyers is whether her court even has the jurisdiction to consider his demands. Trump’s team argued that she did, focusing narrowly on the authority of district court judges to appoint special masters. Left unaddressed is a provision of the Presidential Records Act requiring any legal disputes by a former president under that statute to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/2204#e" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;be filed in the federal district court in Washington D.C&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/2204#e&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf904000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf904000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">be filed in the federal district court in Washington D.C</a>.</p> <p>Trump’s renewed bid reiterates his call for the appointment of a special master and also asks for an immediate halt to the Justice Department’s review of the materials seized from his home. That review has been led by a DOJ “filter team,” which is looking for attorney-client privileged materials, according to court filings.</p> <p>Trump and his allies have suggested that some of the seized materials are covered by executive privilege or attorney client privilege. But the new filing Friday doesn’t say how the records are privileged. Some legal experts have questioned the notion of executive privilege applying in this context, since the Presidential Records Act requires many such records to be turned over to the National Archives at the conclusion of a presidency.</p> <p>And Trump, in the filing, also referred back to the government’s acknowledgment that it had initially seized three of his passports, returning them upon the discovery. His attorneys claimed that “the Government’s continued custody of similar materials is both unnecessary and likely to cause significant harm.” But they offered no evidence to support the claim, declining to specify items they believed the government had improperly taken.</p> <p>The Friday-night filing was submitted by Lindsey Halligan, a Fort Lauderdale-based attorney serving as local counsel for Trump, as well as Washington-based James Trusty and Baltimore-based Evan Corcoran.</p>]]>

Several of those tightly-controlled documents contained Trump’s “handwritten notes,” the partially-redacted affidavit detailing the Justice Department investigation says.</p> <p>In those boxes, agents found 184 unique documents, 25 of which were marked “top secret,” 92 of which were marked “secret,” and 67 of which were marked “confidential”–the lowest level of national security classification. According to the affidavit, NARA officials found some of those “highly classified records were unfoldered, intermixed with other records, and otherwise unproperly [sic] identified."</p> <p>Prosecutors also added in another court filing unsealed Friday that the ongoing criminal probe into government records stashed at Trump’s Florida home has involved “a significant number of civilian witnesses” whose safety could be jeopardized if their identities were revealed.</p> <p>The partial release of the heavily-redacted affidavit and related court documents is the latest development in a fast-moving legal saga that poses an acute threat to the former president. Experts say it is unprecedented in nature. One classified information expert who oversaw such issues across the government said Friday that the scenario laid out was extraordinary and suggested that significant national secrets are at stake.</p> <p>“To my knowledge, this has never become an issue. Most former presidents have played this pretty straight and narrow,” said William Leonard, who headed up the National Archives’ Information Security and Oversight Office. “If it was just the infamous personal note from the North Korean leader to Trump and he refused to part with that, that’s something that obviously could be handled administratively… But I have to think in this instance the information was so sensitive and the potential damage to national security could be so significant that the government felt they had no other choice other than to proceed down this route.”</p> <p>The court filings unsealed Friday revealed that the magistrate judge who issued the warrant for the search of Trump’s residence received legal arguments from Trump’s attorneys before doing so.</p> <p>Those arguments came in the form of a three-page, May 25 letter from Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran. In the letter, Corcoran sought to discourage the Justice Department from proceeding with a criminal investigation or potential criminal charges over the presence of classified records at Mar-a-Lago.</p> <p>“Public trust in the government is low. At such times, adherence to the rules and long-standing policies is essential,” Corcoran wrote. “President Donald J. Trump is a leader of the Republican Party. The Department of Justice (DOJ), as part of the Executive Branch, is under the control of a President from the opposite party. It is critical, given that dynamic, that every effort is made to ensure that actions by DOJ that may touch upon the former President, or his close associates, do not involve Politics.”</p> <p>Notably, the letter came before a June 3 meeting between Trump, his attorneys and DOJ officials at Mar-a-Lago, where the department’s counterintelligence chief Jay Bratt and FBI agents viewed parts of the premises. Trump has repeatedly described his interactions with DOJ as cordial, with aides noting that he shook hands with Bratt during the meeting. But those accounts didn’t mention the heightened tensions reflected in Corcoran’s letter.</p> <p>Similarly, Trump has described that DOJ asked him to install a lock on his storage facility after the June 3 meeting. But DOJ revealed in the affidavit that this request was delivered with far more alarm than Trump conveyed.<br></p> <br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6311441001112" frameborder="0"></iframe> <br> <p>“As I previously indicated to you, Mar-a-Lago does not include a secure location authorized for the storage of classified information,” DOJ wrote in a letter to Corcoran at the time. “As such, it appears that since the time classified documents [redacted] were removed from the secure facilities at the White House and moved to Mar-a-Lago on or around January 20, 2021, they have not been handled in an appropriate manner or stored in an appropriate location.”</p> <p>Corcoran, in his May 25 letter, also argued that presidents have “absolute authority” to declassify documents, although he did not explicitly say that Trump had done so.</p> <p>Some Trump allies have asserted that he explicitly or implicitly declassified materials by taking them from the Oval Office to the White House residence or other locations, though no evidence has emerged of a formal declassification order.</p> <p>Indeed, the affidavit unsealed Friday contains a reference to former Trump adviser Kash Patel — one of Trump’s authorized representatives to the National Archives — claiming in a Breitbart News article that Trump had declassified many of the records at issue.</p> <p>In a post on his social media site, Trump lashed out shortly after the affidavit was unsealed, complaining of heavy redactions and noting that the word “nuclear” wasn’t mentioned despite reports that documents related to America’s nuclear secrets were among the cache held at Mar-a-Lago. Trump, notably, didn’t say whether or not such documents were in fact among them, only that there was no reference to them.</p> <p>Trump also repeatedly slammed Reinhart for authorizing the search saying he should have recused himself from the matter. But Trump — as both Reinhart and the Justice Department have noted in court filings — never attempted to intervene in the matter to either help shape the redaction process, provide more insight on the documents he had at his estate or to formally seek the magistrate’s recusal.</p> <p>In his own letter, Corcoran contended that a technical reading of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1924" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<u>one federal statute covering mishandling of classified information</u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1924&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9080000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9080001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>one federal statute covering mishandling of classified information</u></a> indicates it does not apply to the president. But he did not address whether or how a former president would also be immune from prosecution or retain some declassification power.<br></p> <br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6310951914112" frameborder="0"></iframe> <br> <p>When prosecutors sought the search warrant for Mar-a-Lago, they included Corcoran’s letter in their submission to Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart. However, they did not cite the criminal statute Corcoran referenced as a basis for the search. Instead, prosecutors pointed to possible violations of the broader-ranging and more severe Espionage Act, as well as criminal statutes covering theft of government records and obstruction of justice.</p> <p>The Justice Department had grown alarmed this spring after learning from the National Archives that Trump possessed “highly classified” materials in a Mar-a-Lago storage room, some of which had been returned to the archives earlier in the year. But DOJ came to believe not all of it had been sent back. Trump’s attorneys, meanwhile, delayed the FBI’s access to the retrieved documents earlier this year, <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/wall-letter-to-evan-corcoran-re-trump-boxes-05.10.2022.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;according to correspondence&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/wall-letter-to-evan-corcoran-re-trump-boxes-05.10.2022.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9080002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9080003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">according to correspondence</a> released by the Archives. Ultimately the department resorted to getting a search warrant in order to try and obtain the materials it believed remained at Mar-a-Lago.</p> <p>The much-anticipated release of the affidavit behind that warrant came in response to an order from Reinhart, who partially granted a request from media organizations and a conservative group that the document be unsealed.</p> <p>The Justice Department argued against making even a redacted version of the affidavit public, warning that redactions needed to protect the integrity of the investigation and to prevent harm to individuals would be so extensive as to render the document meaningless. However, the department elected not to appeal Reinhart’s decision to release a censored version of the affidavit to a district court judge or to a federal appeals court.</p> <p>Prosecutors submitted proposed redactions to the court on Thursday morning and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/25/justice-department-proposes-deletions-for-mar-a-lago-search-warrant-00053724" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Reinhart concurred with all of them&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/25/justice-department-proposes-deletions-for-mar-a-lago-search-warrant-00053724&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9080004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9080005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Reinhart concurred with all of them</a>. In an order issued a short time later, the judge said that prosecutors had shown “good cause” to redact elements of the affidavit that would reveal “the identities of witnesses, law enforcement agents, and uncharged parties,” as well as “the investigation’s strategy, direction, scope, sources, and methods” and “grand jury information.”</p> <p>Some of the deletions are intended to shield investigators’ sources and methods for collecting evidence as part of their criminal probe into what Reinhart called the “highly classified” documents the FBI discovered at Mar-a-Lago. Both Reinhart and the Justice Department have noted an uptick in violent threats against those connected to the Trump probe as they laid out their rationale for redactions.</p> <p>While the precise reasons for most of the specific redactions were not revealed Friday, at least some — like withholding the name of the FBI agent who swore out the affidavit — were withheld on grounds of “agent safety.”</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<img src="https://static.politico.com/c9/dc/7a08a930458eb86d2e7b243ed5e1/mag.Ward.HemmerReaganQA.illo.jpg"> <br> <p>In most sweeping histories of the 20th century, Ronald Reagan’s election in 1980 marks the dawning of a new era of American politics, the moment when conservatives finally completed their take-over of the Republican Party and began to remake the country in their own image. According to this narrative, the 30-year period that followed Reagan’s election — often dubbed the “Reagan era” — was defined first and foremost by the Gipper’s relatively sunny brand of conservatism grounded in anticommunism, social conservatism and small-government libertarianism.</p> <p>But there’s another story to be told about the Reagan Revolution — one in which Reagan’s election, rather than marking the start of a new chapter in the history of American conservatism, marks the end of a previous one. In this story, the Reagan era was not a placid period of conservative domination, but rather a time of intensifying ideological conflict over the future of the Republican Party.</p> <p>This is the story that Nicole Hemmer, an associate professor of history at Vanderbilt University, tells in her new book <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/9781541646889" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1661518377869,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-bf09-d5ef-ad97-bf7d2ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1661518377869,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-bf09-d5ef-ad97-bf7d2ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.publishersweekly.com/9781541646889&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-da36-dcde-afcf-fbb663a10001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<i>Partisans: The Conservative Revolutionaries Who Remade American Politics in the 1990s</i>&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-da36-dcde-afcf-fbb663a10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>Partisans: The Conservative Revolutionaries Who Remade American Politics in the 1990s</i></a>, which hits the shelves on Aug. 30. Hemmer, who has written extensively about the <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/messengers-of-the-right-conservative-media-and-the-transformation-of-american-politics/9780812224306" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;rise of right-wing media&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/messengers-of-the-right-conservative-media-and-the-transformation-of-american-politics/9780812224306&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9120000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9120001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">rise of right-wing media</a>, begins her story by noting an apparent contradiction at the heart of the Reagan era: “Nearly as soon as Reagan left office, the conservative movement he represented began to rapidly evolve, skittering away from the policies, rhetoric and even ideology that Reagan had brought into office.” As Hemmer writes in the introduction to <i>Partisans</i>, “With each passing year, conservatives looked less and less like Reagan, even as they invoked his name more and more.”</p> <p>What replaced Reaganism, Hemmer argues, was a “more pessimistic, angrier and even more revolutionary conservatism” that shared none of Reagan’s optimism about the future of the country. This new style of reactionary politics found its mouthpiece in the “partisans” of Hemmer’s book: figures like Pat Buchanan, Rush Limbaugh, Ross Perot, Newt Gingrich, Laura Ingraham and Dinesh D’Souza. Although they tapped into older strains of reactionary politics, their project was essentially forward-looking, more ideologically radical and politically ruthless than the Party of Reagan.<br></p> <br> <p>Figures like Buchanan have received more attention in recent years as historians and journalists have riffled the pages of conservative history for antecedents to Donald Trump. In <i>Partisans</i>, Hemmer casts aside this Trump-centric analysis: “This book is not a prehistory of Trumpism,” she writes in the introduction. Instead, she explores the rise of the GOP’s radical partisans by looking backward at what they rejected — namely, Reaganism — rather than ahead to what they anticipated.</p> <p>But this more scholarly approach doesn’t mean that her argument is totally devoid of contemporary significance, Hemmer told me when we spoke last week.</p> <p>“Even if Donald Trump hadn’t won the presidency in 2016 — even if he hadn’t won the Republican nomination in 2016 — the changes in the Republican Party had still taken place,” said Hemmer. “Something was in the air, something had been changing, something was visible, even without Donald Trump to shine a light on it.”</p> <p><i>The following transcript has been edited for clarity and length.</i></p> <p><b>Ian Ward</b>: You open the book with the line, “This book began with a puzzle.” What was that puzzle?</p> <p><b>Nicole Hemmer</b>: The puzzle at the heart of the book has to do with President Reagan and his legacy. He looms so large in the Republican Party and in the conservative movement, and yet it seemed to me as I was studying the conservative movement that he was really the capstone of a movement that had been in motion since the 1950s, and that he really had started to lose his hold over the party pretty quickly [after being elected]. So even as he became more mythologically grand within the conservative movement, the tenets of Reaganism — the idea of American engagement in the world and the idea of an optimistic, upbeat conservatism and big tent Republican Party — all seem to be on the wane.</p> <p><b>Ward: </b>What were the early signs that Reaganism was being challenged from the right?</p> <p><b>Hemmer</b>: Even while Reagan was in office, there were some real trigger points. Social conservatism was a really big one. There was a group called the New Right, which was a group of social conservatives who tapped into the [Republican] grassroots and into an essentially fear-based style of politics. They just did not gel with Reagan. They attacked him relentlessly for his appointments, for nominating Sandra Day O’Connor to the Supreme Court, for not going hard enough on abortion or guns.</p> <p>And then ultimately, U.S foreign policy was a trigger point as well. You will not see more brutal attacks on Ronald Reagan from any part of the political spectrum than the attacks from the New Right over his negotiations with the Soviet Union in 1987 and 1988.</p> <p><b>Ward</b>: Despite their name, the figures from New Right were drawing on older reactionary traditions in the United States, too. What were those traditions?</p> <p><b>Hemmer</b>: The biggest antecedent is segregation and anti-Black politics. A lot of the energy and the political style of the New Right comes out of the opposition not just to Lyndon Johnson and the Great Society, but specifically to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and ultimately to affirmative action. There’s a real sharpness and meanness to the politics that come up through that.</p> <p>They’re also very tapped into conservative Christian traditions. This is the group that is behind the rise of the Moral Majority and ultimately behind the Christian Coalition, and they are drawing from the older model of prescriptive anti-politics of conservative religious figures in the United States. That tradition goes all the way back to Father Coughlin, but also to Protestants in the 1920s who were trying to prevent people from being able to drink alcohol.</p> <p><b>Ward</b>: There’s a real sense of Confederate nostalgia within this movement as well — and that’s a point where the New Right comes into contact with Reagan, too. In the book, you cite Reagan calling the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “humiliating for the South.”</p> <p><b>Hemmer</b>: Confederate nostalgia is core to this politics, and it often gets coded as states’ rights. I think that's the way that most people who follow modern politics think about it now — that you have the Civil War and this Lost Cause nostalgia, but that gets cleaned up into the language of states’ rights. But that really overlooks how close to the surface it was. That Reagan quote is a great line, but also think of the candidacy of George Wallace [in 1968] and how much he was calling on that Lost Cause ideology and blending it into a sense of decline among white Americans across the board. It had as much appeal in places like Wisconsin as it did in places like Mississippi.</p> <p>And then, of course, there’s Pat Buchanan, who is not just going to someplace like Philadelphia, Mississippi, where Ronald Reagan went to start his presidential campaign and which was near the site where <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/27/case-files-on-1964-civil-rights-worker-killings-made-public-496579" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;three civil rights workers&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/27/case-files-on-1964-civil-rights-worker-killings-made-public-496579&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9120002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9120003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">three civil rights workers</a> were killed [in 1964]. But Pat Buchanan goes to Stone Mountain, Georgia, which is the Mount Rushmore of the Confederacy. He talks about his Confederate ancestors, and it’s not just the Lost Cause — it’s [the sense] that these are our people, and our work is to defend and protect their memory and to advance their causes.</p> <p><b>Ward</b>: In historical terms, how do you explain the dissolution of the Reagan consensus and the rise of this even more radical style of conservatism?</p> <p><b>Hemmer</b>: One of the biggest factors contributing to the fragility of Reaganism was the end of the Cold War. I think in some ways we’ve forgotten how much Reagan was a Cold War president and that the conditions of the Cold War shaped his rhetoric, shaped the policies that he preferred, and really were necessary for the kind of conservatism that he championed. When the Cold War ends, it loosens not just the motivation for conservatives to get involved internationally, but also the motivation for them to champion democracy, which they hold on to a little more lightly after Reagan leaves office.</p> <p>There’s also a massive shift in terms of domestic politics. It had been a goal of conservatives for so long to capture the presidency, and then they had captured it [in 1980], and they didn’t get everything they wanted. They knew that was partly because they hadn’t won control of Congress at that point for something like 40 years. So there is a real refocusing on congressional politics, not just in opposition to Bill Clinton but in opposition to George H.W. Bush as well.</p> <p>And then, importantly, the media environment is changing so rapidly in the 1990s. You have the rise of cable news, you have the rise of new forms of political entertainment in shows like <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/11/bill-maher-isnt-sorry-100229/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Bill Maher’s “Politically Incorrect,”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/11/bill-maher-isnt-sorry-100229/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9120004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9120005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Bill Maher’s “Politically Incorrect,”</a> and you even have the nascent internet. At the start of the ’90s, it wasn’t really possible to have a web browser and to just hop online, but by the mid- to late-1990s, the internet is a huge political player, and it leads to a very different type of politics.</p> <p><b>Ward: </b>The moment when divisions within the Republican Party become really apparent is the 1992 presidential election, which was pretty unbelievable, even by today’s standards. In the Republican Primary, you had an incumbent Republican in George H.W. Bush facing a serious primary challenge not only from Buchanan but from <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/david-duke-louisiana-debate-214414/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;David Duke&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/david-duke-louisiana-debate-214414/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9120006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9120007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">David Duke</a>, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. And then in the general election, there was Ross Perot, who won a larger share of the third-party vote than any candidate since Teddy Roosevelt in 1912. What was going on in 1992?</p> <p><b>Hemmer</b>: I think it speaks to how fractured everything was in the context of massive global and economic change. We think of the end of the Cold War as reshaping the geopolitical landscape, but it also really changed economics and politics in the United States. There is a major recession in the U.S. at the time of the ’92 election, and parts of California that have been propped up by government spending and the aerospace industry had collapsed almost overnight. There was this sense of uncertainty about what the world is going to look like going forward and who is going to prosper and who is going to fail. It’s also at a pivot point in decades of deindustrialization and shifting toward a knowledge economy and a service economy. So things really were in flux, and I think the politics of the day reflect that.</p> <p><b>Ward:</b> The intensity of the Buchanan challenge and the success of the Perot campaign underscored the political importance of a demographic that social scientists had begun calling “Middle American Radicals.” Who are these Middle American Radicals, and what did the 1990s reveal about their place in the Republican coalition?</p> <p><b>Hemmer</b>: “Middle American radicals” is a term that was popularized by Sam Francis, who — spoiler alert — becomes a pretty out-and-out white nationalist by the 1990s, and who was an adviser to the Buchanan campaign. The idea was that there were these people in middle America — today, we often call it “the flyover states” — who were generally white, generally Christian of some stripe, and who had been radicalized by the politics of the second half of the 20th century. There was a sense that they were under threat, that they were no longer the dominant demographic, that they were losing power and losing control of politics. But now they were finally rearing up and fighting back.</p> <p>It’s a lot like the Silent Majority that Richard Nixon talks about, but Richard Nixon’s Silent Majority was supposed to be the opposite of radical. They were supposed to be the reactionaries who were holding the center during a period of change and upheaval in the United States. The idea behind these Middle American Radicals was that no, actually, these are the people who want to radically remake American politics. Sam Francis, and later Pat Buchanan, really tapped into those folks.</p> <p><b>Ward</b>: One of the starkest transformations within the Republican Party that you trace in the book is the GOP’s evolving position on immigration. Reagan, for instance, had fairly liberal, Cold War-era ideas about the free movement of people, but then by the mid-1990s, the GOP has become an avowedly anti-immigrant party. Why did immigration become such a lightning rod for the tensions that were swirling on the right?</p> <p><b>Hemmer</b>: It was one of those issues that had to be activated. The United States is not a place where there has never been anti-immigrant sentiment, but in the 1980s and early 1990s, it just didn’t register for most people as a primary concern.</p> <p>So we have to think about why politicians were able to put it at the top of the agenda, and a big part of it was linking immigration to criminality and linking it to economic threats and economic competition. Pat Buchanan himself in the mid-1980s was talking about immigration as something that’s amazing for the United States and saying that immigrants were hard workers who pay their taxes, so who cares that they’re not necessarily documented? But that all changed by 1992, when he was connecting immigration to all kinds of lawlessness — including the riots in Los Angeles in 1992, which then-Attorney General Bill Barr was also doing — and suggesting that basically anything wrong with your life is being caused by undocumented immigration, particularly if you’re in Arizona or California.</p> <p>For Buchanan, he increasingly leaned on the non-whiteness of these immigrants as a particular threat. They’re not just a threat to your pocketbook, they're a threat to the continued majority status of white people in the United States. That really becomes the big driver of anti-immigrant sentiment in California and then in the rest of the U.S.</p> <p><b>Ward</b>: And this was all taking place at the same time that conservative intellectuals like Charles Murray and D’Souza were embracing new pseudo-scholarly varieties of race science.</p> <p><b>Hemmer</b>: That’s exactly right. These more fixed and pseudo-scientific ideas about race — and in particular about the inferiority of Black people in the United States — became really important to conservatives in the mid-1990s. It sometimes overlapped with immigration, as in the case of Peter Brimelow, who wrote a pretty shockingly racist anti-immigrant tract called <i>Alien Nation</i> in 1995. But when you look at somebody like D’Souza or Murray, what they were adding to their arguments is an older idea about race, which is that Black Americans can’t pull themselves up by their bootstraps [because] they’re in a fixed inferior position — and policy needs to recognize that. That’s different from Ronald Reagan, who wanted to roll back Great Society policies and affirmative action and all those kinds of things, but who didn’t profess this idea of a fixed, innate Black inferiority.</p> <p><b>Ward: </b>In addition to changes in the substance of Republican politics, the style of Republican politics changed quite a bit during the ’90s as well. You quote D’Souza, for instance, arguing that conservatives needed to be “philosophically conservative, but temperamentally radical.” What drove these stylistic changes?</p> <p><b>Hemmer</b>: The stylistic changes were driven a lot by particular figures. They were spearheaded by people like Newt Gingrich, who really believed that Republicans needed a rhetorical style that made it clear that Republicans were the good guys and Democrats were the bad guys. And it’s not just “good” versus “bad.” It is “moral” versus “degenerate.” Gingrich would pick the worst possible words — “treason,” “degeneracy” — to attach to Democrats, and he felt like that was important.</p> <p>It also has to do with things like the rise of talk radio. It was in the early 1990s that Rush Limbaugh became not just a national radio host, but a national political leader. That medium of talk radio did drive a lot of that provocative language, [because] it showed that you wouldn't necessarily pay the price for saying something really over the top and offensive.</p> <p><b>Ward: </b>That darker style of politics was sometimes described in the 1990s as “angry white men politics,” but you point out that these new conservative partisans weren’t exclusively men. What role did women play in pushing the Republican Party to the right?</p> <p><b>Hemmer</b>: Women do play a leading role, in part because they are members of a new class of pundits that was coming up in the world of cable news and who were learning this more pugilistic style of politics. [Figures like Ingraham and Ann Coulter] were very prominent, thanks in part to an organization called the Independent Women’s Forum, which did a lot to take professional women and move them into a political class and a punditry class where they could become the face of the new American right.</p> <p>People like Helen Chenoweth, on the other hand, represented a different kind of threat. She was a representative from Idaho who was grandmotherly and soft-spoken, but her real extremism was in her ties to militia groups. Part of her district in Idaho was Ruby Ridge, where there was a strong militia presence, and she helped spread all sorts of conspiracy theories about government officials, the Bureau of Land Management, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_helicopter#:~:text=The%20black%20helicopter%20is%20a,in%20black%2C%20and%20similar%20conspiracies." target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;black helicopters&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_helicopter#:~:text=The%20black%20helicopter%20is%20a,in%20black%2C%20and%20similar%20conspiracies.&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9120008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9120009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">black helicopters</a>, the United Nations and the like. And it was important that she was a woman and that she looked like a grandmother, because she was much less threatening than 30-year-old white male militia members surrounding a government building or yelling at a government official.</p> <p><b>Ward</b>: How does George W. Bush fit into the story of conservative radicalization that you’re telling? In many ways, he represented the heir to orthodox Reaganism, and it would be easy to point to his presidency and say, “Oh, look, those radical partisans of the ’90s were just a blip on the radar, and the saner, more mainstream conservatism ultimately prevailed.” Why is that the wrong way to think about it?</p> <p><b>Hemmer</b>: If history had stopped in 2004, that would be a very credible thesis, because Bush really was put forward as the second coming of Reagan. He had that same kind of sunny-sighted conservatism, he was interested in more open immigration, and he was very interested, certainly by the end of his first year in office, in America becoming more involved in the world and promoting democracy.</p> <p>But so much of the Reaganism that he embraced failed so miserably during his second term. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the failure to commit to environmental plans were some of the first signs of this failure. But then, by the end of his presidency, the failures in Iraq and Afghanistan and U.S. adventurism abroad were also becoming clear. And then, of course, the financial crisis, financial deregulation and the giant tax cuts — all of that [added to this impression of failure]. By the end of his two terms in office, he had kind of disproven Reaganism and put the final nail in Reaganism’s coffin. He was the testing ground to see if Reaganism was still viable, and by the end of his presidency, he had shown that it was not.</p> <p><b>Ward</b>: How did the Democratic Party respond to these changes within the Republican Party?</p> <p><b>Hemmer</b>: Certainly, liberals during the 1990s were pretty open to the ideas of this new Republican right. One of the things that you see over the course of the 1990s is that the Democratic Party moved steadily to the right. Democratic politicians didn’t back something like Proposition 187 in California, which would have stripped all government services from people in the country without documentation, but they did move pretty far right on immigration, on border security and on the language of demonization around immigration.</p> <p>That’s one of the reasons why I think of the 1990s not as a time of polarization but as a time of right-wing radicalization, because the Democratic Party isn't running away from the Republican Party. Liberals are finding common cause in a lot of ways. In 1995, Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich are sitting down and starting to talk about overhauling Social Security. So yes, liberals at least are on board with a lot of what's happening.</p> <p><b>Ward</b>: They certainly weren’t erecting the barricades.</p> <p><b>Hemmer</b>: No, they were not.</p> <p><b>Ward</b>: A drawback to other, more Trump-centric approaches to conservative history is that they lend a sense of inevitability to Trump’s rise, and in the process, then they overlook the moments when Republicans consciously chose to invite the more radical members of the conservative coalition into the fold. For instance, you mention the episode in 1992 when George H.W. Bush invited Rush Limbaugh to the White House for dinner, and Bush even ended up carrying Limbaugh’s luggage for him.</p> <p><b>Hemmer</b>: I think that particular moment where Bush sides with Rush Limbaugh is an important one, as is the omnipresence of Roger Ailes in Republican politics in the 1980s and 1990s.</p> <p>There were alternatives. Colin Powell is such a fascinating case study, because he comes out of a lineage that included people like Jack Kemp, the representative from New York who was often seen as the heir to Reagan. There were moments where Kemp was like, “What are you doing, Republicans? Stop paddling around with radicals and look at this other legacy that we could be following.” Imagine if in 1996, Colin Powell had won the Republican nomination and the presidency, not just as a Black man, but as somebody who was pro-abortion rights. It is a very different party in that case.</p> <p>Today, that seems so impossible. But this is why the Perot campaign was so important. It seems like in the early 1990s, American voters were open to a lot of different possibilities. The country may have ended the decade as being an increasingly partisan and polarized country, but it didn’t start the decade that way, and that sense of possibility is important for making sense of the ’90s.</p> <p><b>Ward</b>: Trading your historian’s hat for your pundit’s hat for a minute, there’s an analogy to be drawn here with Trumpism. In some senses, Trump has captured the Republican Party today in a similar way to how Reagan captured it back in the ’80s. But as you point out, historians have a tendency to exaggerate the extent of the ideological homogeneity that follows these watershed elections. Are there any fault lines in the Republican Party today that are akin to the fault lines that emerged between Reagan and these partisans in the ’80s and ’90s?</p> <p><b>Hemmer</b>: There is this “<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/inside-the-new-right-where-peter-thiel-is-placing-his-biggest-bets" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;national conservatism&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/inside-the-new-right-where-peter-thiel-is-placing-his-biggest-bets&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf912000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf912000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">national conservatism</a>” that’s arisen today that occasionally has advocates of a stronger social safety net. [But] at the moment, it’s hard to talk about in terms of fault lines, because it’s such an ideologically unsettled moment. It really does seem like on the policy front, a lot of things are up for grabs. You could imagine a heterodox Republican candidate getting away with quite a lot [in the same way that] Donald Trump got away with quite a lot.</p> <p>The thing that makes it hard to see the fault lines right now is this over-arching loyalty to Donald Trump. We’re talking the day after Liz Cheney lost her primary campaign, and that has nothing to do with her politics outside of her relationship to Trump. I do think we're going to continue to see a kind of moderate-radical divide in the party, but it’s just that the center of that divide keeps shifting over further and further and further to the right.</p> <p>I think that in general, most Republicans really do agree on the direction of policy, but the question is, how hardline and how attached to democracy are they going to be. More than anything, that question of “Are we pro-democratic governance or anti-democratic governance” is the real fault line.<br></p> <br> <br>]]>

        <![CDATA[<img src="https://static.politico.com/ea/d8/d7e5a5fd47dc9511695d0480c3a9/jelabi.overrideimage.jpg"> <br> <p>Everyone is in their back-to-school finest. For the incoming Columbia Journalism School class, this means: a lot of Fjällräven backpacks; some of those little <a href="https://www.writepads.com/products/reporter-notebook" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;reporters’ notebooks&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.writepads.com/products/reporter-notebook&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9190000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9190001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">reporters’ notebooks</a> that journalists use in the movies; at least one <i>LA Times</i>-branded mask (is it from a subscription deal or a coveted internship?). Doc Martens abound, so do first-day jitters.</p> <p>A little under 250 new students are masked up and packed into the Joseph D. Jamail lecture hall to hear Dean Jelani Cobb talk about a 118-year-old article that he plucked from the archives. His goal: to get these newly minted J-schoolers to think more clearly about a journalism school’s place in America. The title of the piece, written by founder of the Columbia Journalism School Joseph Pulitzer is “The College of Journalism,” which Pulitzer describes as “a review of criticisms and objections.” And while some of the complaints about the concept of a journalism school feel slightly anachronistic (whether a journalist must be “born” or whether he can be taught) many remain relevant: whether journalism has to be taught in newsrooms, what can’t be taught in a classroom — and whether a “college of journalism” is superfluous.</p> <p>These are a ballooning list of questions that are very much on Cobb’s mind these days as he takes on a job as the public face of the country’s premier J-school. He’s stepping in at a particularly fraught time: Local newsrooms have been hollowed out; the ones remaining are regularly accused of relentlessly chasing clicks and eyeballs, rather than delivering reporting that seeks to educate or hold power to account. <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/10/smug-elitist-senator-hawley-attacks-humble-journalist.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Politicians&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/10/smug-elitist-senator-hawley-attacks-humble-journalist.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9190002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9190003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Politicians</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/07/capitol-attack-trump-targeted-journalists" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1661476432937,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f77-dc58-a78d-3fffa1f10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1661476432937,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f77-dc58-a78d-3fffa1f10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/07/capitol-attack-trump-targeted-journalists&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d7b6-dfd1-adef-dffe64880001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;their fans&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d7b6-dfd1-adef-dffe64880000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">their fans</a> regularly attack the credibility of the press.

He’s spent six years teaching at the J-school while also contributing to <i>The New Yorker&nbsp;</i>(a job he will continue), but dean-hood comes with a distinct set of challenges.</p> <p>It’s easy to arrive starry-eyed, imagining the ways you and your students can–and will–change the world. Then comes the fundraising.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/3d/78/7d10b1ff42398443c935deca0fc6/cobb.secondary.1.jpeg"> <br> <p>An M.S. in journalism from Columbia — all told a nine and a half month program — costs an estimated $121,290. Depending on where you’re looking, a journalist with a master's degree makes on average between $36,000 and $58,000 after graduating. Columbia can offer generous aid packages (73 percent of those who applied for scholarship aid received funding and the median award is approximately $40,000), but its students are also regularly drowning in debt. For many young people with journalistic aspirations, the training that Columbia provides is a luxury they literally cannot afford.</p> <p>Cobb is all too aware of the problem. He told me that he regularly hears from students who have always dreamed of becoming journalists but now worry about how they’ll pay for school or how much of a burden their debt will be. “It’s not a novel idea that we need to find some other way for this to exist,” he says. “We just don’t know what that is right now.”<br></p> <br> <p><b>Jelani Cobb did not attend</b> journalism school himself, an irony of which he’s very cognizant. Born William Anthony Cobb in Queens, New York, he learned to write from his father, an electrician named Willie Lee Cobb who had a third-grade education, but made his children's education a top priority. Jelani says he remembers his father’s large hand engulfing his tiny one in their home as he learned the alphabet.<br></p> <br> <p>Cobb was the youngest of four in his family, though the only child his parents had together. He went to Howard University, where it took him seven years to complete his undergrad because he didn't have the money to consistenly pay tuition — he spent much of that time freelance writing and protesting in on-campus demonstrations. (He occupied administrative buildings to protest apartheid and the appointment of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/30/obituaries/lee-atwater-master-of-tactics-for-bush-and-gop-dies-at-40.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Lee Atwater&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/30/obituaries/lee-atwater-master-of-tactics-for-bush-and-gop-dies-at-40.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf919000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf919000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Lee Atwater</a> as a trustee of the University.) When he was 19, he changed his middle name to Jelani, a Swahili word that means “full of strength” or “powerful,” for, he says, “a very serious and a less serious reason.” For starters, he wanted to reconnect with his African heritage, a connection that “has been taken away from many Black people in the United States forcibly.” And then there was the problem of his initials: W-A-C. He didn’t want to be “wac(k)” anymore.</p> <p>If his seven years at Howard weren’t enough, Cobb then embarked on a Ph.D. program in history at Rutgers. He credits mentors in undergrad and his love of the physical spaces of college campuses for his continued interest in academia — the high school he attended, Jamaica High School, was designed by the same architects who designed Columbia. Preparing for his new job, Cobb recently stumbled upon his old personal statement about why he wanted to go get a history Ph.D; he wrote that he thought it would make him a better journalist.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/5a/e3/541462d342d78217825cfdbb86f2/cobb.secondary2.jpeg"> <br> <p>Cobb has been ensconced in the world of academia for years, all the while occasionally leaving the classroom to report as well. And his reporting has borne fruit: In 2018, he was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in commentary for “combining masterful writing with a deep knowledge of history and a deft reporter’s touch to bring context and clarity to the issue of race.” Meanwhile, a <a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2016.122ab" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;gas mask Cobb wore while covering the Ferguson protests&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2016.122ab&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf91a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf91a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">gas mask Cobb wore while covering the Ferguson protests</a> and the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement is in the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.</p> <p>His office is still a work in progress (“a painting issue,” he tells me). His books are boxed up and still in his old faculty office downstairs. The essentials that have made their way up to the dean’s office (which was already replete with a table, desk and some couches) are his elegant road bike — he’s got a clunkier electric one as well, he says — and a photo he took of his daughter Christine, now five, playing in water sprinklers.</p> <p>“My daughter keeps referring to me as ‘the dean,’” he says, laughing. “She thinks that comes with a cape.”<br></p> <br> <p><b>Reporting on the ground </b>and working in academia are not always a natural fit. Hang around certain academic circles long enough and it’s easy to get afflicted with a certain kind of circular thinking. Comparatively small problems all become the result of structural factors out of your control.</p> <p>Example: Journalism school is too expensive. This is especially true given that journalists can’t hope to make much money after they graduate. And it gets worse when you think about where graduates end up right out of school. They either don’t want to or can’t afford to take a low-paying local news job in a smaller city or town — if those even exist anymore. So they stay in New York or Washington. This contributes to the professional networks that drive job opportunities and elite bias in the media. These biases lead to worse reporting, fewer people interested in journalism and fewer checks on the crooks that steal from the poor and give to the rich, who are the ones setting the market on how expensive graduate programs are. Journalism school’s big price tag is actually a <a href="https://popula.com/2021/08/12/is-the-journalism-crisis-just-a-capitalism-crisis/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;crisis of capitalism&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://popula.com/2021/08/12/is-the-journalism-crisis-just-a-capitalism-crisis/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf91a0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf91a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">crisis of capitalism</a>.</p> <p>For someone proudly on the political left like Cobb, there’s probably little wrong with that logic. He knows these arguments from his decades in academia. But, they can also be paralyzing: If everything requires a total teardown of our broader systems, what do we do while we’re waiting for the revolution?</p> <p>Cobb is eschewing that logic to examine the problem in a way that befits the trade school that he’s been tasked to lead. Journalism school is too expensive. Which means he needs to fundraise to make it cheaper.<br></p> <br> <p><b>Beyond the issue of cost, </b>there is the question of what nine months in this highly intensive place can teach students. Certainly, it can help them build a certain skill set: how to report and interview; how to write clearly; how to file a FOIA request. And it certainly links students into professional networks — and to coveted internships and jobs. Cobb is also laser-focused on historical context, something he says young journalists can easily lack. He wants them to have at least “50 years of working knowledge” in major areas of interest from U.S. foreign policy to Capitol Hill to criminal justice. And though he’s a liberal columnist, he says that students are often “surprised” by his commitment to not imposing personal views on readers.</p> <p>“One of the clichés of Dr. Cobb’s class is, ‘the information you have is not as important as the information you don’t have,’” Cobb says.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/1c/72/11404284434080435566c07b66fc/cobb.secondary3.jpeg"> <br> <p>I didn’t go to J-school myself, so I decided to take the day I had on campus to soak up what I could from one of America’s preeminent teachers of the craft.</p> <p>“If you had a student who was writing a profile of the new dean of Columbia Journalism School, what kind of advice would you give them?” I ask.</p> <p>“This conversation just became very meta,” Cobb says. He stands at an imposing 6’3”, but in his reporting, he takes a cue from the famously diminutive Joan Didion: “Be small.”</p> <p>“You should not take up space in a room until you want to take up space in a room … [and] ask something the person wasn’t expecting,” he says. “So I think that’s probably a question that would qualify.”</p> <p>It’s not so easy for Cobb to be small these days, and not just because of his large stature. Walking around Morningside Heights with Cobb — where he lives and works — he’s recognized on the street by someone who’s seen him on MSNBC. That happens a lot. At a neighborhood bookstore, Cobb grabs two volumes that he’s preordered: Salman Rushdie’s essay collection, “Languages of Truth” and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff’s “Midnight in Washington.” Cobb is a man of varied interests, though the California representative’s Republican critics might say both books include magical realism.</p> <p>Returning to Cobb’s office, which boasts views of Columbia’s stately campus, we walk by displays of numerous high-profile awards his school awards, from the National Magazine Awards to the DuPont-Columbia Awards to the Pulitzer Prizes. There are carved busts and painted and photographed portraits of some of Columbia Journalism School’s luminaries, including its previous deans. It’s a whole lot of white guys; Cobb is Black.</p> <p>“The arc of my career has been being a Black person in rooms where there were fewer and fewer Black people,” Cobb says. “That is what it is. But also, why critique it if you’re not interested in actually trying to change it?”<br></p> <br> <p><b>The late journalist David Carr,</b> who gave both Cobb and Ta-Nehisi Coates their first real reporting gigs at the <i>Washington City Paper</i>, once <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/business/media/columbias-new-journalism-dean-looks-ahead-in-a-digital-era.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;described Columbia Journalism School&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/business/media/columbias-new-journalism-dean-looks-ahead-in-a-digital-era.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf91a0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf91a0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">described Columbia Journalism School</a> as “Hogwarts for wizards who type.” Serving as its newest Dumbledore, Cobb hopes to expand the place to be welcoming to more than just the "pure-blood" (Columbia already gets much better marks than Hogwarts on the diversity front, to be fair).<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/5f/d0/fabd481544c4b210b15132ec85a3/cobb.secondary4.jpeg"> <br> <p>Cobb wraps up his welcome address, turning the microphone over to Winnie O’Kelley, Columbia’s dean of academic affairs. It’s almost his birthday, and O’Kelley is armed with a surprise: red velvet cake. (There are cupcakes in the back, too, to accommodate 250 some-odd students and staff). She walks up to the microphone and leads the room in an awkward, off-key rendition of “Happy Birthday.”</p> <p>“I’m totally putting that on my [Instagram] story,” a new student says.</p> <p>Cobb cracks a big smile. He already looks at home in this environment. It helps that he can ply his new students with some free food.</p> <p>Still, he’s resisting the urge to get too comfortable.</p> <p>“I want us to be a pipeline that helps make the [journalism] field itself more democratic. I don’t have any illusions about how complicated that undertaking will be,” Cobb says.</p> <p>But he’s here because he wants to try. Because, after having conversations about inequity in the field for years, now he’s got the chance to mold the school to fit his vision. “You have a conception of what this place is,” he says, “and also what this place <i>could</i> be.”<br></p> <br> <br> <br>]]>

He worked as a volunteer on Barack Obama’s first <i>state senate</i> campaign before eventually working in his presidential administration. He modeled Howard Dean’s 2004 presidential run in his own precocious, even pushy initial try for Congress going on 20 years back. He was a national co-chair of Bernie Sanders’ 2020 bid, and <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Dignity-in-a-Digital-Age/Ro-Khanna/9781982163341" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;his new book&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Dignity-in-a-Digital-Age/Ro-Khanna/9781982163341&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9200000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9200001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">his new book</a> got <a href="https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/1501278094644195329" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1661464541568,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1661464541568,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/1501278094644195329&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d700-d289-a3bb-d7eff13f0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;kudos on Twitter from Bill and Hillary Clinton&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d700-d289-a3bb-d7eff13f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">kudos on Twitter from Bill and Hillary Clinton</a>. And in the conference room here at New Castle Stainless Plate, the audience made up of the company’s CEO plus a clutch of his right-hand men, Khanna had road-tested pieces of a message he’s been honing for years. “Make more stuff here,” he said. “Build our productive capacity,” he said. “Buy American,” he said.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/c1/4e/4ffe6fb843c9982f53c4db625c29/mag.kruse.khanna.stainlessgrid.jpg"> <br> <p>These, of course, are not new ideas. But the combination of the messenger and the locale was unusual. In August, when most members of Congress are in their respective districts or perhaps off elsewhere to raise funds, Khanna was here — not only <i>not</i> at home but in a red part of a red state, <i>not</i> asking for their money, and <i>not</i> asking for their votes (at least not yet). Instead, he was here in Indiana, then Wisconsin, then Iowa, sharpening a key plank of his overall political pitch, attempting to rehab his party’s reputation in an area of the country that’s become increasingly inhospitable, and also very obviously laying seed for his own evident presidential ambitions. And maybe the most surprising part of this surprising scene? It appeared to be working.</p> <p>Because now out on the factory floor, the supply chain manager sidled up to me to express some mixture of confusion and pleasant surprise.</p> <p>Fred Centner thought former president Donald Trump had had “a lot of good ideas.” The former president also, unfortunately, was “an idiot,” Centner said. He wishes he would just go away. Before this visit from Khanna, he had looked him up, pegging him as a “typical liberal.” The way Khanna was talking, though, sounded to Centner a lot like … Trump.</p> <p>Make more stuff here? “That’s what Trump wanted,” he said over the noise of the heavy machinery. Buy American? “It’s a Trump concept.

The subject line of Johnson’s emailed invites: “Bringing tech jobs to the Heartland.”</p> <p>Pavey, the mayor from Rushville, admitted during introductions he and the two city and county officials who joined him had made the hour-or-so drive somewhat skeptically. “I said, ‘What’s he up to?’” granted the local economic development director. Another Republican mayor Johnson had approached but who had not come, Pavey said, had been blunt: “Why would a representative out of California come to Indiana to take jobs away from his area and promote them here?”<br></p> <br> <p>Khanna had anticipated that wariness. “Look, you people in this room will disagree on where I stand on abortion, on gay marriage. But why can’t we find the place where we do agree?” he said.</p> <p>“I just think we’ve got to wake up as a country across the political divide and come together on how we build the next generation of manufacturing in America. And we’ve got to get these jobs not just in Silicon Valley, or New York, or Austin, but around the country,” he said.</p> <p>“We have forgotten what won World War II. It was a victory of production. I mean, it was obviously the men who sacrificed their lives in Normandy, and our amazing military, but the way we really won is we outproduced Japan and Germany by orders of magnitude.”<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/6c/40/1df64db34035b71255b1ccad8894/mag.kruse.khanna.wendys.jpg"> <br> <p>Khanna, according to former and current advisers and aides, is at heart something of an academic and a policy wonk. But he’s keen, too, on the language of politics and persuasion even to the point of bumper-sticker slogans. It matters what you say, he believes, but realistically, it might matter even more how you say it.</p> <p>“He’s just very good from a messaging perspective,” Steve Spinner, a friend and mentor and Khanna’s campaign chair for the past decade, told me. “That’s an area that Democrats historically struggle with, from the White House on down, and it’s something that Ro is actually quite good at.”</p> <p>“He is one of the few people,” said Jane Kleeb, <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/our-leadership/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a board member of Our Revolution&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://ourrevolution.com/our-leadership/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9210000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9210001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a board member of Our Revolution</a>, the progressive political action organization launched by Sanders in 2016, “that get how to talk about rural economic development without sounding like they’re reading off a talking-point sheet.”</p> <p>“And it’s so ironic,” said Johnson, “that it’s coming from somebody who represents Silicon Valley.”</p> <p>He’s good at it because he works at it. Which is why being with Khanna at times can feel like a real-time catch-phrase workshop.</p> <p>“Economic patriotism,” Khanna said not once but three times in the two-hour roundtable with the mayors at the Hampton Inn.</p> <p>“<i>Economic patriotism</i>,” said Brian Sheehan, Rushville’s community development director, repeating it back to Khanna. He told Khanna to trademark the term. “Awesome,” he said. “I think that’s the kind of thing that connects to everyone.”</p> <p>“I was impressed by the fact that it seemed like his goal was to help our region and do it in a bipartisan way,” Pavey told me. “I’m encouraged.”</p> <p>“I hope that you’re running for a higher office,” Greg York, the mayor of New Castle, told Khanna. York is a Democrat, but in 2016, he told me, he voted for Trump. He voted for Joe Biden in 2020. In 2024, though, he wants to vote for somebody else. “I hope that’s why you’re visiting us,” York said.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/ec/22/814775c741efbd5c841ccd225ee2/mag.kruse.khanna.family4grid-new.jpg"> <br> <br> <p><b>Now we were in Anderson, Ind.,</b> in a back booth of a Texas Roadhouse just off Interstate 69, tinny, too-loud country music blaring from a speaker on the ceiling. Khanna ordered a half slab of ribs with green beans and corn. I suggested this “economic patriotism” message sounds different coming from him rather than, say, white, more immediately identifiably “Rust Belt” candidates like Tim Ryan in Ohio or John Fetterman in Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Khanna concurred. “I think people underestimate biography and identity in people’s perception.”</p> <p>The Hindu grandson of a freedom fighter in the Mahatma Gandhi-led independence movement and the son of Indian immigrants, his father a chemical engineer and his mom a substitute teacher addressing the functional needs of children with disabilities, Khanna was born in 1976 in Philadelphia — in America’s bicentennial year, in the home of Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, a historical coincidence I’m emphasizing only because he so frequently does.

Invent it here, produce it here, buy it here …”</p> <p><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Dignity-in-a-Digital-Age/Ro-Khanna/9781982163341" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Khanna’s new book&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Dignity-in-a-Digital-Age/Ro-Khanna/9781982163341&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9220000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9220001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Khanna’s new book</a>, <i>Dignity in a Digital Age: Making Tech Work for All of Us</i>, is too early and a little too nerdy to be seen as the kind of familiar, almost obligatory offering from somebody running for something, but this impromptu evening event fairly quickly did turn into what felt to me like a rough-cut town hall of a proto-presidential campaign. He painted an explicit contrast with Trump. “He sold false hope,” he said. “We actually have a real vision.” And here in the late summer of a midterm year, Khanna worked his way toward the sort of closing I’ve come to expect at a different point in the political calendar before walking out into the cold in some dot on the map in Iowa or New Hampshire.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/4e/b7/894377d84ccab1c8ffecc779dd5b/mag.kruse.khanna.ender.jpg"> <br> <p>“People love this country. They want America to win. They want us to lead because we’re a great nation. And they know we’re a great nation because of stories like mine,” Khanna said. He acknowledged sometimes it was hard growing up with immigrant parents and brown skin and the name Rohit. “But that’s not what I remember about growing up in Bucks County, Pa.,” he said. “I remember Little League coaches who believed in me. I remember the local paper, the <i>Bucks County Courier Times</i>, that published my letters to the editor in a community that was 95 percent white. I grew up believing I could do anything in this country. That’s the story of America. That’s the essence of America, whether in Bucks County, Pa., or New Castle, Ind.”</p> <p>After the people clapped, I went to the rear of the room to talk to a woman wearing a Sanders shirt. “I don’t know why he’s here,” Jessika Feltz, the vice chair of the county party, said of Khanna, “but I <i>like</i> that he’s here.”</p> <p>I wondered if she would vote for Khanna for president.</p> <p>“Hundred percent,” she said.</p> <p>“Over Biden?” I asked.</p> <p>“Hundred percent.”</p> <p>Khanna came over to thank her for coming. “Run for president,” she said. He laughed. She laughed. But it didn’t sound like they were joking.</p> <p>A few days later, following stops in Janesville, Wis., and Dubuque, Iowa, I got a text from Khanna. “I have refined my pitch to a new economic patriotism,” he said. “The word new is key as it gives a sense of future and technology.” Coming from him, coming from Silicon Valley, he added, “it’s something fresh, with a fresh pair of eyes and thinking that is resonating.”<br></p> <br> <br>]]>

        <![CDATA[<img src="https://static.politico.com/74/6c/845b3ddf4f06bd5f888764718038/mag.Schaffer.RapoportPutin-Lede-Override.jpg"> <br> <p>The mysterious death last week of a prominent critic of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in Washington’s West End neighborhood is drawing fury from some of the Kremlin’s best-known global detractors — but scant notice in Washington, where police say they don’t suspect foul play was behind Dan Rapoport’s fall from a luxury apartment building on the night of Aug. 14.</p> <p>“I think the circumstances of his death are extremely suspicious,” says Bill Browder, the formerly Moscow-based American financier who became a crusader for sanctions after the killing of his Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky. Browder got to know Rapoport in Moscow years ago, before they both fell out of favor with the Russian regime. “Whenever someone who is in a negative view of the Putin regime dies suspiciously, one should rule out foul play, not rule it in.”</p> <p>According to a Metropolitan Police Department incident report, officers responding to a call about a jumper found the 52-year-old Rapoport’s body on the sidewalk. He was wearing orange flip flops and a black hat and had a cracked phone, headphones and $2,620 in cash on him, but no wallet or credit cards. The police say the case remains open, even without a suspicion of foul play. As is standard for suspected suicides, a medical examiner’s report — which would typically reference medical or other records, include a toxicology screen and incorporate X-rays and other posthumous forensics to determine if there was a struggle before the fall — is pending.</p> <p>The deceased was no mere exile. A Latvian-born U.S. citizen, Rapoport moved back to the U.S. in 2012 after making a fortune in Moscow but running afoul of the Russian government. Settling in Washington, he rubbed elbows with mover and shakers, living in a Kalorama manse that his family later sold for $5.5 million in 2016, when it became the home of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. By then, Rapoport had relocated again, setting up shop in Kyiv, where he became a frequent contact of U.S. media.</p> <p>In the eyes of Rapoport’s political allies, the history of untimely deaths of Kremlin critics makes the police’s initial no-foul-play conclusion seem naive. “He was a well-known critic of Putin in the West and had been an effective critic,” Browder says. “He was also an open supporter of [the jailed opposition leader] Alexei Navalny. And he had all these connections in the elite of Washington, D.C. The immediate response of the Washington, D.C. police, I think, is a premature and unhelpful conclusion.”<br></p> <br> <p>“Nothing adds up,” says David Satter, a longtime Moscow correspondent in Soviet and post-Soviet times who in 2013 became the first U.S. reporter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/13/russia-expels-american-journalist-david-satter" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;booted from Russia&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/13/russia-expels-american-journalist-david-satter&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9260000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9260001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">booted from Russia</a> since the Cold War. Satter, now a frequent <i>Wall Street Journal</i> contributor and the author of several books about Putin’s Russia, had stayed with Rapoport in Kyiv. “This is why it has to be investigated. But everything we do know is very, very strange.”</p> <p>Rapoport’s death has been the subject of <a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/russia/putin-critic-found-dead-in-mysterious-circumstances.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;major&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.kyivpost.com/russia/putin-critic-found-dead-in-mysterious-circumstances.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9260002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9260003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">major</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/russian-exile-death-washington-dc-dan-rapoport-b2146923.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;coverage&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/russian-exile-death-washington-dc-dan-rapoport-b2146923.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9260004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9260005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">coverage</a> <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11119333/Anti-Putin-businessman-mysteriously-dead-Washington-DC.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;overseas&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11119333/Anti-Putin-businessman-mysteriously-dead-Washington-DC.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9260006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9260007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">overseas</a>, but is oddly off the radar in Washington, where there has been little major media attention. It’s a strange and possibly telling omission from our midterm-absorbed city’s water-cooler conversation: A number of high-profile figures are implying that a foreign government may have killed an American citizen in the capital of the United States. Even if their conjectures are overblown, it ought to be news.</p> <p>The suspicions, Browder says, began when the news of Rapoport’s death first broke on the Telegram channel of a former editor of Russian Tattler, via a convoluted story that claimed Rapoport’s dog was let loose with a suicide note and cash attached to him. Because intelligence services often put out information through gossip sites, the location raised antennae. “How the hell did she [the ex-Tattler editor] learn about Dan’s alleged suicide?” asks Vlad Burlutsky, a Russian expat who met Rapoport through his work supporting Navalny.</p> <p>In a <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/business/17/08/2022/62fba9269a794768cfb8b420?from=from_main_7" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Russian media interview&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.rbc.ru/business/17/08/2022/62fba9269a794768cfb8b420?from=from_main_7&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9260008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9260009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Russian media interview</a>, Rapoport’s wife denied the story about the note — and the suicide, saying her husband had been making plans and that she expected to be in Washington to see him. (The police report also makes no mention of a note or a dog.)</p> <p>“I’ve talked several times to Alyona, his widow, and she says she is absolutely certain that it’s not a suicide,” says close friend Ilya Ponomarev, the only member of the Russian Duma to vote against the annexation of Crimea and now a strident Putin critic also living in Kyiv.</p> <p>Ponomarev says he’s less certain. But he fears a repeat of what happened in 2015, when Putin’s former media czar <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/2015-death-of-former-putin-aide-at-dc-hotel-ruled-accidental-result-of-alcohol/2016/10/28/f5b2a63e-9d1f-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;died&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/2015-death-of-former-putin-aide-at-dc-hotel-ruled-accidental-result-of-alcohol/2016/10/28/f5b2a63e-9d1f-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf926000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf926000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">died</a> in odd circumstances in Washington and, in his view, U.S. authorities soft-pedaled the investigation. “I would not be surprised that it would be the same thing, that people don’t want to deal with some crazy Russians,” he says. (Alyona Rapoport did not respond to my messages, and has only been quoted in a single Russian media story since confirming his death on Facebook.)</p> <p>The case for suspicion involves some more basic practical questions: What was up with the wad of cash? Why would Rapoport have been making plans for the next few days? Why was he wearing a hat?</p> <p>But mainly the suspicion has to do with Russia. “There’s an old saying that anyone can commit a murder but it takes brains to commit a suicide,” says Satter. “The version of suicide is for the irrelevant people who will simply accept it and move on without raising questions.”</p> <p>Born in the USSR, Rapoport came with his parents to the U.S. at age 11, settling in Texas. After graduating from college, he moved to Russia in the wild post-Soviet days, settling in Moscow after a stint in Siberia. He made his fortune there as a stockbroker, eventually opening Soho Rooms, one of the city’s top nightspots. But in 2012, he announced that he was leaving Russia, declaring on Facebook that life there had become “unbearable and disgusting.”</p> <p>In Washington, Rapoport and his Russian-born wife settled into the exclusive Kalorama neighborhood, enrolling a child at Maret, a top local private school. Acquaintances here describe a frenetic, intense personality, someone with ups and downs. He dabbled in the dining industry here, too, says Winston Bao Lord, a tech entrepreneur whose investments are largely in the hospitality space. He met Rapoport, who at the time had some money invested in an Alexandria restaurant, to pitch an idea that never panned out. Lord says Rapoport was a jocular social presence. “He was a big partier when I knew him,” Lord says. “He was a confident guy that felt very strongly about his views.”</p> <p>Rapoport appeared occasionally in the media with Kremlin-critical posts. In 2018, the open-source investigative platform <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2018/04/02/curious-case-david-jewberg-fake-senior-pentagon-russia-analyst/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1661467603653,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f77-dc58-a78d-3fffa1f10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1661467603653,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f77-dc58-a78d-3fffa1f10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2018/04/02/curious-case-david-jewberg-fake-senior-pentagon-russia-analyst/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d72f-dcde-afcf-f7bfaa3e0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Bellingcat reported&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d72f-dcde-afcf-f7bfaa3e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Bellingcat reported</a> that Rapoport was behind the Facebook page of David Jewberg, purported to be a senior Pentagon analyst. The entirely made-up Lieutenant Colonel Jewberg was frequently quoted in Russian and Ukrainian media (and by some of Rapoport’s Washington friends) as a real U.S. defense insider. Mostly in Russian, the posts were critical of the Obama administration’s insufficiently aggressive stances toward Russia and Facebook’s alleged pro-Russia bias.</p> <p>“Dan is likely the most intelligent person I’ve ever met,” says Yuri Somov, who struck up a friendship with Rapoport in Washington. “And I’ve met people like Kissinger and Greenspan. I’m a professional interpreter. He was incredibly intense and very much larger than life, but in a good way.” Somov describes himself as apolitical, but says his friend was different: “He was a romantic. He believed things could be changed and he believed he could be a part of those changes.”</p> <p>Washington, Somov says, was probably not Rapoport’s natural milieu. In 2016, after divorcing, he left town, moving to Kyiv, where the tumultuous scene might have represented an opportunity for someone whose first experience was in crisis-racked post-Soviet Moscow. His ex-wife and kids stayed here. “He was too different from the world of U.S. business,” Somov says. “He probably felt closer to home in Ukraine than in the U.S.”</p> <p>Somov, who says he’s been devastated by Rapoport’s death, is among those who thinks the suicide story is completely plausible.</p> <p>“Not every unexplained death in Russia is the KGB or the GRU bumping someone off,” says Fiona Hill, the former senior Russia specialist at the White House, who met Rapoport through Somov.</p> <p>Rapoport had remarried in Kyiv to a Ukrainian virologist; they’d started a new family. After the war began, Rapoport relocated his wife and child to Denmark but stayed in Ukraine — and then came to Washington this summer, shipping his dog as well. Missing them, friends say, left him distraught.</p> <p>“He was having to start over again for the third time in 10 years,” Somov says. “We did not meet up, which I will regret for the rest of my life because he probably needed me. When he asked me, ‘lunch tomorrow?’ after not seeing each other for several years, I should have read between the lines. I must have asked him something, but I remember the answer, which is still in my phone: ‘It has been a very difficult three months.’ From him, particularly, that’s saying a lot. More than notable, it was extraordinary. No matter how things worked, he kept up appearances.”</p> <p>Ponomarev also says Rapoport didn’t seem great when they barbecued in Washington during a visit this summer. He said Rapoport had cut way back on drinking after his second marriage, but was drinking heavily when they met up. “It was very clear he was depressed that he was not with his family,” he says. Still, it didn’t seem desperate. “I cannot exclude that it was a suicide, but in general nothing pointed in this direction when we met. If I would feel like something like this could happen, I would talk to him more.”</p> <p>But for a number of people in Rapoport’s anxious political circles, it’s hard to put stock in coincidences. “He was making plans for the future. He had plans for the next week and the week after,” says Jason Jay Smart, a Kyiv-based American political consultant who says he spoke weekly with Rapoport over the past half-decade. “It’s not something someone who was planning on jumping off a building would do.”</p> <p>And there’s history to make Russian skeptics suspicious of Washington authorities’ investigative chops. In 2015, Mikhail Lesin, a former media aide to the Russian president, died in Washington’s Dupont Circle Hotel. Initially reported as a heart attack, the medical examiner later <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/28/499750029/u-s-attorney-s-office-mikhail-lesins-death-was-an-accident" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;determined&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/28/499750029/u-s-attorney-s-office-mikhail-lesins-death-was-an-accident&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf926000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf926000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">determined</a> that he had died of blunt force trauma. But the report was later amended to say that the death had been an accident, the injuries sustained possibly from falling off a bed after he returned to his hotel room extremely drunk. Prosecutors closed the case. “That was outrageous,” Ponomarev says.</p> <p>Closer to Rapoport — but further from politics — his partner in Soho Rooms died in an apparent suicide after his own fall from a building, in Moscow in 2017. One Rapoport friend speculated that foul play could be business-related rather than political, though Satter says the two aren’t so easily separated. “Even if it was just business interests, that doesn’t mean the Russian intelligence service wasn’t involved,” he says. “They often use these disputes.”</p> <p>The Russian embassy did not respond to a request for comment by deadline.</p> <p>The FBI says it does not comment about whether it is investigating alongside the locals. And the medical examiner’s report, alas, may not be here to clear things up anytime soon: All “unnatural” deaths, even open-and-shut suicides, get sent for a report. They can take up to 90 days.</p> <p>In the meantime, people who find the death fishy — as well as people who merely find it heartbreaking — can probably see evidence in Rapoport’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dan.rapoport.3/posts/pfbid02XvZSVnxtEFd8Y91PSWuEGZsPMsT9iGwgodMeHSP3jVyL2XrxRzjncVmVZF21r9fQl" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;final Facebook post&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dan.rapoport.3/posts/pfbid02XvZSVnxtEFd8Y91PSWuEGZsPMsT9iGwgodMeHSP3jVyL2XrxRzjncVmVZF21r9fQl&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf926000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf926000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">final Facebook post</a>, three days before his death.

New York will give you first dibs to sell marijuana, legally.</p> <p>While 19 states have legalized recreational weed, New York is the first to offer its initial dispensary licenses solely to entrepreneurs with marijuana convictions. It’s a move aimed at offering an advantage to people, disproportionately in Black and brown communities, harmed by the war on drugs.</p> <p>“We think that leaning into folks who are not only justice-involved, but have that business experience means that we’re going to find a bunch of applicants who have gone through some significant challenges to still open and operate successful businesses,” Office of Cannabis Management executive director Chris Alexander said in an interview. “We just took a different approach.”</p> <p>Most states have let medical dispensaries be the first to roll out recreational products, which has largely let big fish get bigger.

The decision to set aside the first licenses in such a large market for justice-involved individuals also sets New York apart in its effort to achieve equity in the cannabis industry.</p> <p>“Too often those folks are paid lip service but not actually given the opportunity,” he said.</p> <p>Kristina Lopez Adduci, founder and CEO of New York City-based House of Puff, which sells cannabis accessories, lauded the steps New York has taken to remove barriers and prioritize those affected by the drug laws in its initial licensing. But, like Castille, she said it’s too early to say whether those efforts are enough.</p> <p>Adduci, for example, said the $200 million social equity fund “is fantastic, but it won’t move the needle entirely” given the costs of opening and operating a marijuana dispensary. The state, she argued, should ensure these businesses also have access to incubator programs and workforce education.</p> <p>If selected, dispensary applicants are subject to a four-year conditional period in which they cannot sell or transfer their licenses, according to <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2022/07/new-york-finalizes-rules-marijuana-dispensaries-00045863" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1661366575201,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1661366575201,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2022/07/new-york-finalizes-rules-marijuana-dispensaries-00045863&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d12a-d7cf-a983-d3af198e0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;program rules finalized in July&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d12a-d7cf-a983-d3af198e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">program rules finalized in July</a>. After that, they will transition into full retail licenses.</p> <p>DiPisa, who has worked with clients looking to apply for the licenses, noted that although applicants get to select their preferred regions, they ultimately don’t get to choose the location of their dispensary that they’ll be locked into for four years — even if it’s in the region of their choice.</p> <p>“How much control is the (license) holder going to have on the look and feel of their space?” he said.</p> <h3 style="text-align: left">Trying to create an equitable program</h3> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/ba/a2/76dc81e4473d9aa2278cb8100dad/ap22199602563948.jpg"> <br> <p>Alexander said the Office of Cannabis Management expects that because New York will provide ongoing support, operators will hold on to their licenses and continue to grow their businesses after the four years. Some, however, have raised concerns that large multi-state marijuana companies could then buy up the initial licenses.</p> <p>Adduci said she hopes New York takes “note from other states who have made those mistakes,” adding that she’s already started to see “predatory deals” emerge.</p> <p>“Predatory deals come across my desk and say, ‘Hey, if you win a license I’ll give you $10 million for it,’” she said.</p> <p>DiPisa argued that a takeover by large cannabis industry operators would “usurp the entire reason for the program” — wanting New York to own its cannabis market. He, however, argued that preventing social equity owners from selling their licenses would also go against the intentions of the program.</p> <p>“The whole point of this is to put them on a pedestal, give them the opportunity to be profitable,” he said. “Why shouldn’t they be able to build a business, realize the ‘American dream’ and sell their business off? It’s honestly something that I don’t know how to make heads or tails of. It’s a hard thing to reconcile because you want both, but you can’t have it all.”</p> <p>That is the line the Office of Cannabis Management is trying to straddle with its regulations. Alexander said New York can’t stop sales from occurring after the four-year period.</p> <p>Although New York is the latest state to move toward dispensary sales, industry observers say the size of its market — and position at the center of world finance — raise the stakes of getting a sustainable cannabis “social equity” program.</p> <p>Alexander said he expects New York to make “new mistakes" as it rolls out its own equity approach to a state-level legal marijuana marketplace. He also acknowledged that New York’s program will not “solve all the problems” that exist in the cannabis space, like banking challenges.</p> <p>But Castille said that if New York's program can be successful, it “would send a big signal to people.”</p> <p>“New York is a great first stab at the sort of new era of what legalization could look like when fully wrapping social equity into that,” he said, adding that “no matter what comes out of New York, it’s likely to set a new foundation.”</p>]]>

But Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. and Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri want every school district to buy in.</p> <p>“You can do all the things you want to do with curriculum and advance everything that goes on with teaching and learning,” Diaz said in an interview. “But if parents don’t have the feeling that they can drop off their kids and pick them up safely in the afternoon — we haven’t done anything.”</p> <p>Ohio is in the process of distributing $100 million for schools to pay for equipment such as security cameras and automatic door locks with help from federal Covid-19 relief funds.

Ron DeSantis suspended four Broward County School Board members Friday in the wake of an <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2022/08/parkland-grand-jury-wants-desantis-to-boot-4-school-board-members-00052966" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;explosive grand jury report&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2022/08/parkland-grand-jury-wants-desantis-to-boot-4-school-board-members-00052966&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9350003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9350004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">explosive grand jury report</a> that called for their ouster over a “neglect of duty and incompetence” in managing a multimillion bond for campus security.</p> <p>The move — the latest fallout for Broward school leaders since the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School — coincided with DeSantis appointing four new board members, giving Florida’s Republican governor new allies in a Democrat-leaning area.</p> <p>In a statement, DeSantis said that he hopes the action “brings the Parkland community another step towards justice.”</p> <p>“It is my duty to suspend people from office when there is clear evidence of incompetence, neglect of duty, misfeasance or malfeasance,” DeSantis said in a statement. “This action is in the best interest of the residents and students of Broward County and all citizens of Florida.”</p> <p>The Parkland grand jury, in a 2021 report released just last week, said that five board members — Patricia Good, Donna Korn, Ann Murray, Laurie Rich Levinson and Rosalind Osgood — along with the district’s top leadership “need to go” after examining their performance on a massive school bonding program aiming to bolster school safety and other areas. Commissioned by DeSantis, the grand jury was called to probe school safety in Florida after a lone gunman in 2018 shot 34 people, killing 17 at Stoneman Douglas.</p> <p>The Broward bond project, approved by voters about four years before the Parkland shooting, was promised to be completed by the end of 2021 for $987 million yet is now estimated to wrap up in 2025 for nearly $1.5 billion, according to the grand jury, which questioned if the district would even make that deadline. The grand jury claimed the board members failed to hold school officials accountable and were slammed for “deceit, malfeasance, misfeasance, neglect of duty and incompetence.”</p> <p>“We applaud the Governor’s action to follow the recommendation from Florida’s 20<sup>th</sup> Statewide Grand Jury and remove the Broward School Board members — citing their gross-negligence, misfeasance, malfeasance, and shear incompetence caused the mishandling of many of the aspects of the tragic date that took the lives so many at Marjory Stoneman Douglas,” said Stand with Parkland president Tony Montalto in a statement.</p> <p>Out of the four sitting school board members scrutinized in the report, the terms of Levinson and Murray are set to expire in November with neither seeking reelection.</p> <p>Korn is pursuing another term and is now engaged in a runoff election for the seat; Good’s term is set to expire in 2024.</p> <p>Osgood, meanwhile, is now a state senator and “therefore not subject to the Governor’s executive suspension authority,” according to the DeSantis administration.</p> <p>To replace the board members, DeSantis appointed Torey Alston, Manual “Nandy” A. Serrano, Ryan Reiter and Kevin Tynan. It’s unclear which appointment is associated with each separate board term.</p> <p>Alston previously served as the chief of staff at the Florida Department of Transportation under the DeSantis administration. And DeSantis previously appointed him to the Broward County Commission.</p> <p>Serrano is member of the Florida Sports Foundation Board of Directors and CEO and founder of Clubhouse Private Wealth, a financial consulting firm.</p> <p>Reiter is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and director of government relations for Kaufman Lynn Construction in Delray Beach.</p> <p>Tynan, an attorney with Richardson and Tynan, previously served on the Broward County School Board.</p>]]>

But simultaneously, U.S. and Iran-backed forces clashed in Syria this week in several skirmishes that left four militants dead and three U.S. service members wounded.</p> <p>U.S. officials say the attacks in Syria are not related to negotiations over the Iran deal. But the split screen highlights the challenge the administration faces in making progress on one of its top Middle East priorities — bringing Iran back into compliance with the nuclear deal — while Tehran’s proxies continue to foment violence against the U.S. and its allies in the region.</p> <p>“Whenever the U.S. and Iran are close to successful negotiations, actors on both sides try to disrupt them,” said Joe Cirincione, a national security expert and author who formerly served as president of the nuclear nonproliferation-focused Ploughshares Fund. He noted that Israel and elements of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps are opposed to the deal. “The goal is the same: to create a crisis that would make diplomacy impossible, a deal unobtainable.”<br></p> <br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6311348765112" frameborder="0"></iframe> <br> <p>In this case, experts said the Biden administration’s strategy — prove it can walk and chew gum at the same time — was effective.</p> <p>“We defended ourselves immediately and we are still in negotiations,” said Mick Mulroy, a former Pentagon official in the Trump administration.</p> <p>Even as officials made progress in nuclear negotiations in recent weeks, Iranian proxies have been increasingly active in the region. In Syria, IRGC-directed militants have intensified low-level attacks against U.S. and coalition positions in Syria, Defense Department officials said.</p> <p>Iran may be trying to use the activity in Syria to gain some leverage in nuclear talks, said Seth Jones, an expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But more important for Tehran is getting U.S. troops out of the Middle East, where Iran has expanded its influence in recent years, he said.</p> <p>“This fighting, the violence right now in Syria is broadly symptomatic of the tensions right now that the U.S. is having with the Iranians,” Jones said. “Some of them are military, some of them are at the diplomatic table.”</p> <p>On Aug. 15, two incidents in Syria caught the administration’s attention: one unsuccessful drone strike in the vicinity of al-Tanf Garrison and one rocket attack on Green Village. The U.S. did not respond immediately but spent several days ensuring that retaliatory strikes sent the right message and didn’t kill anyone.</p> <p>“DoD worked to select a target that would send the message we wanted without further escalating the situation,” a senior administration official said. “They conducted hundreds of hours of intelligence collection to help ensure the strike did not cause casualties while also preparing the ground to respond should the Iranian-backed groups choose to attack again after our strike. It takes time to do this right.”</p> <p>But one senior DoD official — who, like others in this article, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic — said that one reason the response took a few days was for officials to debate the impact on nuclear negotiations.</p> <p>On Tuesday, on Biden’s order, U.S. fighter jets struck Deir ez-Zor, Syria, against bunkers used by groups affiliated with the IRGC. The U.S. military had initially identified 11 targets at the site, but ultimately struck only nine due to evidence of movement near two of the bunkers shortly before the strike, said the Pentagon’s top policy official, Colin Kahl.<br></p> <br> <p>The retaliatory strike was designed to signal that the U.S. will defend itself regardless of where negotiations stand on the nuclear deal, Kahl said.</p> <p>“The administration has been pretty clear that in the event that Iran moves back into compliance with the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action], that's in our interest, because it pushes Iran further away from a nuclear weapons capability. But whether the JCPOA is reborn or not, it actually has nothing to do with our willingness and resolve to defend ourselves,” Kahl said. “The strike last night was a pretty clear communication to the Iranians that these things are on different tracks.</p> <p>The response was likely designed to reassure U.S. allies that Washington can still push back on Iran’s nefarious action in the region while negotiating a nuclear agreement, Cirincione said. In fact, top Israeli officials <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/23/israelis-u-s-iran-nuclear-deal-00053363" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;visited Washington this week, as the government ramped up pressure on Biden to walk away from the nuclear deal.&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/23/israelis-u-s-iran-nuclear-deal-00053363&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9370002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9370003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">visited Washington this week, as the government ramped up pressure on Biden to walk away from the nuclear deal.</a> Israeli national security adviser Eyal Hulata met with counterpart Jake Sullivan at the White House on Tuesday — the same day the strikes occurred in Syria.<br></p> <br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6311343965112" frameborder="0"></iframe> <br> <p><br>“The U.S. will deny that there is any connection but I’m a superstitious man, I’ve seen this pattern all too often,” he said. “They want to conclude the deal, they have to reassure the allies — this is their way of doing that, and I think it worked.”</p> <p>But the skirmishes did not end there. In retaliation, IRGC-backed militants launched rocket attacks on two separate sites in northeastern Syria, Green Village and Conoco, which wounded three U.S. service members. One U.S. service member was treated for a minor injury and returned to duty, while two others are under evaluation for minor injuries, a statement from U.S. Central Command said at the time.</p> <p>In their initial response, U.S. attack helicopters destroyed three vehicles and equipment used to launch some of the rockets. The militants then attempted to launch additional rockets, but American forces pummeled the position with attack helicopters, gunships and artillery. Altogether, the U.S. military killed four enemy fighters and destroyed seven enemy rocket launchers in the fighting.</p> <p>After the strike, the Pentagon assessed that the latest salvo was over and deterrence had been reestablished, said a third U.S. official.</p> <p>So far, the back-and-forth has not appeared to hold up progress on the nuclear discussions. For one thing, the two sides appear to have moved past the Biden administration’s refusal to remove the IRGC from the Foreign Terrorist Organization list.</p> <p>The U.S. relayed to the EU on Wednesday its response to Iran’s latest comments on the draft proposal. This stage of talks is expected to focus on the final sticking points, related to Iranian demands for economic guarantees and sanctions relief.</p> <p>“We are closer now than we were even just a couple of weeks ago because Iran made the decision to make some concessions,” said John Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council.</p> <p>But he cautioned that “a lot of gaps remain. We’re not there yet.”</p> <p><i>Alexander Ward and Nahal Toosi contributed to this report.</i></p>]]>

Glenn Youngkin, himself a possible presidential contender; former Pennsylvania Senate candidate and hedge fund executive David McCormick; and Vivek and Lakshmi Garipalli, members of a New Jersey family that has donated large sums to Democrats — but which gave Haley’s organization $1 million.</p> <p>The donor list also includes dozens of people who gave anonymously to Haley’s nonprofit but have not given disclosed contributions to her PAC, which was formed two years later and is required to regularly disclose the names of donors who give at least $200. Those contributors include the Garipallis and GOP megadonor Joe Ricketts.</p> <p><a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000182-da41-d289-a3bb-daefde680000" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;(See the full list of donors here.)&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000182-da41-d289-a3bb-daefde680000&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf93a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf93a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">(See the full list of donors here.)</a></p> <p>Like other nonprofits, Stand For America files an annual tax return with the IRS. While the agency and the nonprofit must make those filings available to the public, including the amounts of contributions to the group, such nonprofits do not have to disclose the identities of their donors.</p> <p>However, the organization Documented, which describes itself as a nonpartisan government watchdog that investigates money in politics, obtained an unredacted copy of Stand For America’s 2019 filings, which it then shared with POLITICO. The group did not share the original source of the filing, but it bears a stamp from the charity office of the New York state attorney general.</p> <p>The disclosures provide the clearest picture yet of how a prospective 2024 presidential candidate is cultivating a secret network of high-dollar contributors as she builds a political apparatus. And the names of her donors demonstrate the deep connections Haley has formed at the top levels of the Republican Party, with some of the GOP’s biggest super PAC donors among those who gave money to fund the launch of her organization after she left the Trump administration.</p> <p>Haley is among <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/11/2024-presidential-campaign-dark-money-00024241" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;at least a dozen other&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/11/2024-presidential-campaign-dark-money-00024241&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf93a0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf93a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">at least a dozen other</a> would-be White House hopefuls— including former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence — who also have allied nonprofits bankrolled by donors whose identities have remained under wraps.<br></p> <br> <p>“It’s very rare that the public has the opportunity to see the identities of the donors who are providing five- or even six-figure contributions to a dark money group. It’s called dark money for a reason. Typically, the public does not know who is financing these groups, and this is a rare exception,” said Brendan Fischer, deputy executive director of Documented.</p> <p>“This previously unpublished donor list provides a valuable clue as to the network of wealthy donors that Haley might rely upon if she does ultimately run for office,” Fischer said.</p> <p>Such tax filings are typically closely held, as donors contribute to nonprofit groups with the understanding that their names will be kept secret. The Haley team moved to stop publication of this story, with attorney Michael Adams writing in a cease-and-desist letter that POLITICO “was not authorized to receive the confidential tax return information, nor is Politico entitled to print, publish, or even retain it.”</p> <p>Lynn Oberlander, an attorney for Ballard Spahr representing POLITICO, responded in a letter that the reporting on the funding of U.S. political activity “is in the public interest and fully protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.”</p> <p>POLITICO reached out to each donor named in this article prior to publication. They either did not respond or declined to offer comment.</p> <p>“This disclosure of a confidential tax return was clearly a corrupt violation of state and federal law to try to intimidate conservative donors,” Haley said in a statement. "Liberals have always weaponized government against conservatives, and Republicans have been too nice for too long. We will make sure the buck stops here.”</p> <p>The nonprofit is a political asset for the 50-year-old Haley, a former South Carolina governor long known as a favorite in the GOP donor world. When she launched the group in 2019, it was five years since her most recent run for office, and she could use the group to build a fresh new email list of supporters, pay staff and fund travel, polling and policy research.</p> <p>Just because a donor gives to her nonprofit does not necessarily indicate they will back a future presidential bid. Many of the contributors are also known to support other potential candidates, including Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.</p> <p>The contributions from 2019 also represent a snapshot in time: The donors gave before Trump lost his 2020 reelection race and immediately pivoted to make himself a frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.</p> <p>Documented says it has not obtained the unredacted version of Stand For America’s most recent IRS filings, which cover the 2020 calendar year. The redacted 2020 filings show that the organization raised $9.3 million that year, with the largest single contribution totaling $750,000.</p> <p>Haley stepped down from her post in the Trump administration at the end of 2018 and launched Stand For America shortly after. The 501(c)(4) “social welfare” organization’s mission, according to its website, is to support “policy that will ensure a stronger, safer, and more prosperous country for all Americans.”<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/3c/0f/fb046fdb4c25b0eafdca7c3a4228/election-2022-house-south-carolina-97320.jpg"> <br> <p>Over the course of 2019, the filing shows, Haley received the support of 71 donors who gave at least $5,000, for an overall fundraising total of $7 million.</p> <p>The biggest givers were New Jersey health executive Vivek Garipalli and his mother, Lakshmi Garipalli, who contributed $500,000 apiece. Vivek Garipalli has been a regular Democratic donor, giving to the likes of President Joe Biden and Senate Democrats — but he has a “longstanding personal friendship” with Haley and her husband, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4951313-Nikki-Haley-2018-Annual-OGE-Form-278e.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;according to a federal financial disclosure document&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4951313-Nikki-Haley-2018-Annual-OGE-Form-278e.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf93a0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf93a0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">according to a federal financial disclosure document</a> Haley filed in 2018, when she was serving as U.N. ambassador.</p> <p>Garipalli gifted Haley New York Knicks tickets valued at nearly $20,000 that year, and he gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to a pair of <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000182-db05-dcde-afcf-fbb755580000" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;pro-Haley political action committees&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000182-db05-dcde-afcf-fbb755580000&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf93a0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf93a0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">pro-Haley political action committees</a> when she was governor of South Carolina, <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000182-db07-dcde-afcf-fbb73f9e0000" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;according to campaign finance filings&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000182-db07-dcde-afcf-fbb73f9e0000&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf93a0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf93a0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">according to campaign finance filings</a>.</p> <p>Haley’s next-biggest nonprofit donors in 2019 were the Adelsons, who each donated $250,000. (Sheldon Adelson died in early 2021.) Miriam Adelson — who has since become the most sought-after megadonor in the GOP — also donated the maximum-allowed $5,000 to Haley’s PAC in 2021, her first federal donation since her husband’s death. Haley was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/07/miriam-adelson-megadonor-back-in-politics-519912" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;one of a handful&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/07/miriam-adelson-megadonor-back-in-politics-519912&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf93a000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf93a000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">one of a handful</a> of would-be candidates who landed a private meeting with Miriam Adelson while attending a Republican Jewish Coalition conference in the fall of 2021.<br></p> <br> <p>The third-biggest donors were Stanley Druckenmiller and his wife, Fiona, who gave a combined $350,000. Next was Scott Bessent, an investor with a long history of giving to Republicans, who contributed $325,000. Singer, another prominent GOP megadonor, gave $270,000.</p> <p>Haley’s donors span the party’s ideological spectrum, from those supportive of Trump to those less so. She attracted six-figure nonprofit donations from Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, who extensively funded Trump’s 2020 reelection effort, but also Druckenmiller, who backed former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a moderate Republican, over Trump in the 2016 primary.</p> <p>Haley has separately launched Stand For America PAC, which unlike the non-profit vehicle must disclose its contributors and has a donation limit of $5,000. The PAC can spend unlimited amounts on politics, though the size of donations are capped. And while the nonprofit can raise and spend in unlimited amounts, it has restrictions on how much it can spend on expressly political activity.</p> <p>Some of Haley’s donors have only given through the dark money vehicle. While the Garipallis and Bessent are among Stand For America’s biggest donors, they have yet to give to Stand For America PAC, according to the most recent federal filings. The same goes for Republican megadonor Ricketts, who gave $50,000 to the nonprofit Stand For America but nothing to the PAC, which was registered in 2021.</p> <p>Haley’s nonprofit vehicle — like those aligned with other prospective 2024 candidates — is using its funding to pay political consulting firms doing work for the group. Stand For America’s highest-paid vendors, according to the filing, include prominent Republican consulting firms: direct mail firm Image Direct and a pair of digital firms, Coldspark and Fifth Influence.</p> <p>The nonprofit has also promoted Haley’s policy platform, and it has developed an extensive email list of prospective supporters. Stand For America sends out a five-day-a-week policy newsletter to more than 200,000 subscribers, has aired issue advocacy commercials in states like Georgia and Virginia, and hosted virtual town halls for supporters.</p> <p>In addition, the organization has conducted congressional outreach on certain issues, published a 160-page policy book and produced a series of policy videos in which Haley has participated.</p> <p>All of the activity helps to promote Haley as she ramps up for 2024. A future Haley campaign could rent or buy the email list to build out its fundraising apparatus, for example.</p> <p>“The reality is that some potential candidates are relying on a small handful of very wealthy donors as they map out their political future,” Fischer said. “And if those candidates win office, they’re going to owe an immense debt of gratitude to those secret donors.”</p>]]>

The group's ads are now set to begin in early October.</p> <p>In November Masters will face Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), who already enjoys a heavy financial advantage down the stretch. The super PAC's move will exacerbate that Kelly edge as Republicans seek to net the one seat needed to take back Senate control. Republicans currently see Georgia and Nevada as potentially more fertile territory to flip than Arizona, and they also have to protect seats in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio and beyond.</p> <p>The McConnell-backed super PAC's strategic change is in part a reaction to its massive $28 million commitment in Ohio, where GOP nominee J.D. Vance is facing a strong challenge from Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio). The organization said it will reallocate the money elsewhere and is not planning to totally pull of out Arizona at the moment, as Kelly <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/arizona/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<u>leads</u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/arizona/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf93d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf93d0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>leads</u></a> Masters in essentially every recent public poll.</p> <p>“We’re leaving the door wide open in Arizona, but we want to move additional resources to other offensive opportunities that have become increasingly competitive, as well as an unexpected expense in Ohio,” said Senate Leadership Fund President Steven Law. “We think the fundamentals of this election strongly favor Republicans, we see multiple paths to winning the majority, and we are going to invest heavily and strategically to achieve that goal.”</p> <p>Still, there are signs that the GOP is keeping Arizona on the table. OneNation, a GOP nonprofit affiliated with the super PAC, included the state in a new round of ad buys, according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/26/politics/senate-republican-spending-summer/index.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;CNN&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/26/politics/senate-republican-spending-summer/index.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf93d0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf93d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">CNN</a>.</p> <p>Both Masters and Vance were supported in their Republican primaries by GOP donor Peter Thiel and former President Donald Trump. It’s not clear whether Thiel will help either candidate in the general election. </p> <p>Absent further GOP investment, the super PAC's move will likely leave Kelly and his allies with a huge money advantage this fall. Kelly and Democratic groups have more than $40 million reserved for the fall, while Republicans had about $18 million before the super PAC shifted money away from the state, according to AdImpact.</p> <p>While the change in Arizona might raise questions about Republicans’ view of Masters’s chances, Law said the decision to cut two weeks — or about $1.7 million in advertising — to boost Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) is a vote of confidence in her. Murkowski advanced to the top-four general election with about 45 percent of the vote compared with 39 percent for Trump-backed Kelly Tshibaka; the general election will be decided by ranked-choice voting.</p> <p>“We are all-in for Senator Murkowski. Senator Murkowski is in a very strong position and based on that decided to push back our start date,” Law said. Ads supporting Murkowski’s bid will now begin Sept. 20.</p> <p>The National Republican Senatorial Committee separately <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/15/gop-slashes-ads-in-key-senate-battlegrounds-00051969" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1661535652768,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014f-12ad-d3b2-a96f-1aad247d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1661535652768,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014f-12ad-d3b2-a96f-1aad247d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/15/gop-slashes-ads-in-key-senate-battlegrounds-00051969&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-db3e-db61-a1fb-fbfe05600001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;canceled&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-db3e-db61-a1fb-fbfe05600000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">canceled</a> millions in ads earlier this month, planning to reprogram them to get more efficient buys alongside GOP candidates but sparking some skepticism about the group’s strategy.

Both were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential investigation.</p> <p>The suit would be the latest major legal problem besetting the country’s biggest tech companies two years after federal regulators and multiple states filed antitrust cases against Google and Facebook.

Justice Department officials will likely want to wait for the outcome of the appeal to help decide how to frame a possible lawsuit. In her ruling, the trial judge expressly said that while Epic did not prove its case, it's possible that another plaintiff could.</p>]]>

Ron DeSantis’ voter fraud crackdown were notified by official government entities they were eligible to vote, according to court documents and interviews.</p> <p>The defendants told authorities they had no intention of committing voter fraud, according to affidavits, and in some cases were baffled by their arrests because counties had sent them voter registration cards and approved them to vote.</p> <p>The defendants were vilified by the governor during a high profile press conference last week, where DeSantis announced the arrest of 20 people — convicted murderers and sex offenders — who allegedly cast votes in the 2020 election when they weren’t eligible to. The defendants, because of their convictions, weren’t permitted to vote.</p> <p>DeSantis highlighted their arrests to show his new $1.1 million election security office, created during the 2022 legislative session, was paying off and rooting out bad actors looking to commit voter fraud. Such fraud has become a top tier issue for Republicans across the country, including DeSantis, who has championed a series of election reform bills, including the creation of a first-of-its kind election investigations unit housed under Republican Attorney General Ashley Moody.</p> <p>In the days since the announcement, however, several of those arrested have told media outlets or authorities that they had no idea they were not eligible to vote. In court documents filed in five counties, most say at least one official government body — in most cases a local election supervisor — incorrectly indicated to them they could vote, including allowing them to register and sending them voter cards in the mail.<br></p> <br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6311104081112" frameborder="0"></iframe> <br> <p>Court records show that many who were swept up by authorities have little education or financial resources and are now back in the state’s criminal justice system. Florida Department of Law Enforcement special agents interviewed the defendants over a few days in early August before arresting them last Thursday.</p> <p>Peter Washington, a 59-year-old Black man from Orlando, who served 10 years in prison related to sexual battery conviction, told a Florida Department of Law Enforcement special agent that prison officials informed him he could vote. At the time, he was taking classes to transition back into society as his release date from prison approached. He received no indication from the Orange County Supervisor of Elections office that he was not eligible to vote.</p> <p>“Washington received a voter registration form in the mail, filled it out and mailed it back to the Orange County Supervisor of Elections Office,” read an affidavit filed by authorities in Orange County court. “The Orange County Supervisor of Elections mailed him a voter card.”</p> <p>Voting rights groups have been highly critical of Florida’s creation of the election investigation office and DeSantis’ decision to arrest 20 people. They argue it's symptomatic of an overall broken system, and that the people could have been removed from the voting rolls rather than arrested in their homes, especially considering local election officials had permitted them to vote.</p> <p>“To see the state going after folks and dragging them out of their homes in handcuffs and throwing them in jail, that is just overreach, especially when the state knows there was not intent,” said Desmond Meade, executive director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition.</p> <p>Meade was one of the chief architects of Amendment 4, which voters approved in 2018 and setup a framework for most ex-felons to regain their voting rights.</p> <p>Michelle Stribling, a 52-year-old Black woman from Eatonville convicted in 1993 of second degree murder, told investigators during an Aug. 5 interview at her house that she “could not read or write very well,” and did not understand questions related to her status as an ex-felon on registration paperwork. But Orange County election officials mailed her a voter card after she registered, which led her to believe she was able to vote.</p> <p>“Stribling believed that her rights were restored because she completed the voter registration application and received a voter registration card,” read her probable cause affidavit.</p> <p>Leo Grant, a 55-year-old Black man from South Bay, told Florida department of law enforcement special agents he has been diagnosed with stress, depression and wears a pacemaker. He also told authorities that a local election office sent him a voter identification card and was able to vote without issue.</p> <p>“Grant remembers filling out his vote-by-mail ballot at his house and mailing it in for the November 2020 election by putting it in a Post Office mailbox,” read the criminal affidavit.</p> <p>Grant told the Miami Herald last Friday, one day after the DeSantis press conference and his arrest, that he was completely confused by the ordeal.</p> <p>“I don’t really understand, how did I commit fraud?” Grant <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article264698334.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;told the newspaper.&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article264698334.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9550002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9550003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">told the newspaper.</a> “I don’t understand any of this stuff.”</p> <p>Meade said it should be reasonable for citizens to trust that when the government tells them they can vote, that they are eligible.</p> <p>“It is their [government’s] responsibility to make the determination on eligibility to vote and to send you a voter education card,” Meade said. “It is purely natural for a citizen to rely on the government to make those determinations and that they be accurate.”</p> <p>His group on Thursday set up a bail and legal defense fund for those arrested, most of which do not have significant personal financial resources.</p> <p>“We don’t want anyone to take plea deals just because they can’t pay bail,” Meade said. “They are in danger of losing their jobs, and some are key providers for their families. This could impact more than just the individuals.”</p> <p>Meade said his group is now advising that those arrested not speak to anyone, including the media, until they have attorneys other than public defenders, which his group is helping facilitate at no charge.</p> <p>Attorney Larry S. Davis, who is representing one of the men arrested in Miami-Dade for free, said his client was arrested at 6 a.m. when a SWAT team banged on his door.</p> <p>“He was in his underwear, and they would not let him get clothed before taking him to jail,” Davis said. “There were people in his backyard who were armed, and they used a helicopter. It disrupted the entire neighborhood very early in the morning.”</p> <p>Davis would not identify which client he represented because the person is concerned they will lose their job over the arrest.</p> <p>“They were approached to register to vote at a local WalMart. When they said they could not register because they were a felon, the person there said they could because Amendment 4 passed,” David said. “They helped him fill out the paperwork. He later got a voter card, and thought he could vote. That was two years ago.”</p> <p>The defendants come from Orange, Palm Beach, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade and Broward counties. Only Miami-Dade County responded when asked for comment.</p> <p>Suzy Trutie, the deputy Supervisor of Elections in Miami-Dade County said that when a county gets a registration applications they are forwarded to the state, which uses a series of databases to verify the person’s identity.</p> <p>“After the verification process has been completed, the State notifies the County that the person’s eligibility has been confirmed,” she said via email. “Finally, the County issues a voter registration card to the elector.”</p> <p>Alison Novoay, spokesperson for the Palm Beach County Supervisor of elections, said in an email that the state notifies their office when a prospective or registered voter is convicted of a felony or otherwise ineligible. After that, the Supervisor of Elections removes them from their voting lists.</p> <p>“We were not notified by the state prior to 2022 that these individuals were ineligible,” she said. “Upon notification we immediately commenced the removal process.”</p> <p>After the story was posted, DeSantis’ communications director Taryn Fenske sent a statement to POLITICO pointing to a state statute that “the supervisor must ensure that any eligible applicant for voter registration is registered to vote.”</p> <p>“I want to point out that when you register to vote in Florida, you check a box to affirm that you are not a convicted felon, or if you are, your right to vote has been restored,” Fenske said after POLITICO’s story posted. “The murders and sex offenders that were arrested have due process, and they will get the opportunity to make their case.”</p> <p>She did not answer follow-up questions about whether she believes the state has any role in verifying voter eligibility, as both Palm Beach and Miami-Dade election officials indicated they do.</p> <p>A rule instituted by the Florida Department of State, which administers elections, in 2009 outlines that the state “shall identify voters … who are potentially ineligible based on a felony conviction without civil rights restored.” Once identified, that list “shall be provided to the Supervisors of Elections.” The governor’s office did not respond Friday night when asked about this rule.</p> <p>When DeSantis announced the arrests during a press conference at the Broward County courthouse, he said it was just the first wave of arrests. Beyond felons, his election investigations office is looking at allegations that undocumented immigrations may have illegally voted as well as individuals who voted twice in one election.</p> <p>There have been three arrests made in The Villages, a Republican stronghold in central Florida, related to people admitting they voted twice in the 2020 election. DeSantis did not hold events highlighting those arrested, each of whom entered pretrial diversion programs and avoided jail time.</p> <p>“This is just the first step. There are many more in the pipeline” DeSantis said during last week’s press conference. “We are not just going to turn a blind eye to this. The days of that happening in Florida are over.”</p>]]>

Growth has already slowed — initial readings of GDP showed the economy contracted in the first two quarters of the year — even as inflation has shown signs of cooling off.</p> <p>The persistence of high inflation has sparked a blame game in Washington, with Republicans faulting both the Biden administration's big spending packages and the Fed's delay in raising interest rates.</p> <p>Indeed, Powell's words were a stark about-face from his remarks at the same conference last year, when he said elevated inflation was likely to prove temporary. Now, his message is intended not only to warn the American people that economic pain is ahead but also to deter financial markets from expecting the Fed to reverse course next year.</p> <p>Before his remarks, many investors expected the central bank to begin lowering borrowing costs later next year as a possible recession looms. That had led market rates to fall and stock prices to rise from their June depths — the exact opposite of what the central bank wants to see as it aims to slow spending and investment.</p> <p>But the Fed chief said the battle against inflation would likely mean “a sustained period” of slow growth, with a level of interest rates that keeps the economy on a tight leash. He also said there would “very likely” be some pain in the job market, which could mean a jump in the unemployment rate — that is, millions of job losses.<br></p> <br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6310077450112" frameborder="0"></iframe> <br> <p>“These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain,” he said, arguing that letting inflation fester would only cause additional hardship in the future because the Fed would have to act more aggressively. </p> <p>“History shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay,” he said.</p> <p>Many attendees of the conference, who were hoping for tough talk from Powell, were pleased. At six pages, his speech was considerably shorter and more direct than remarks at this venue generally are. That gave markets little room to read something unintended into his words. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 stock index plunged after the speech. </p> <p>“It was extremely disciplined, extremely tight. Just saying, ‘we’re on this path, we’re staying on this path,’ and not overcommitting, not overpromising,” said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p> <p>Powell’s former Fed colleague, Randal Quarles, called it “exactly what was called for in the moment.” He said the central bank likely needed to get its main borrowing rate up close to 4 percent — it currently sits between 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent — and “they're on the path to do that.”</p> <p>The economy is already slowing, though it still shows “strong underlying momentum,” according to Powell.</p> <p>As for inflation itself, there are some early signs it is easing. The Personal Consumption Expenditures index — the Fed’s preferred inflation measure — showed prices actually fell slightly from June to July, driven in part by lower gas prices, according to data released Friday. But they’re still up 6.3 percent from a year before.</p> <p>“While the lower inflation readings for July are welcome, a single month’s improvement falls far short of what the committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down,” Powell said.</p> <p>He put responsibility for fighting price spikes firmly in the court of the Fed, although inflation has also been fed by factors that it can’t control, such as supply chain disruptions and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>“It is true that the current high inflation is a global phenomenon, and that many economies around the world face inflation as high or higher than seen here in the United States,” Powell said. “None of this diminishes the Federal Reserve’s responsibility to carry out our assigned task of achieving price stability. There is clearly a job to do in moderating demand to better align with supply. We are committed to doing that job.”</p>]]>

Karla has ALWAYS had her ear to the ground for people, and she’s a natural galvanizer. Great pick!”</p> <p>Florida Sen. Jason Pizzo, also a Miami Democrat, described her as “bright, warm and tough.”</p> <p>Since 2016, Hernández-Mats has served as president of the United Teachers of Dade, which touts itself as the largest teachers union in the southeast. She is also on the governance board of the Florida Education Association, which is the state’s largest teacher’s union.</p> <p>FEA support of Crist played a pivotal role in the primary. The organization not only endorsed him, but pushed for the rest of the state’s labor organization to follow suit with a primary endorsement, even as some did not want to endorse before the general election. It led to a contested fight during the AFL-CIO’s summer convention in Orlando, which Crist ultimately won.</p> <p>“We’re thrilled by Charlie Crist’s choice for his running mate. Karla Hernández-Mats will be a great lieutenant governor of and for all the people of Florida,” Florida Education Association President Andrew Spar said. “She's a mom with two kids in our public schools, a teacher focused on students with special needs, and cares deeply about children, families and communities.”</p> <p>Crist’s pick ensures education will remain at the forefront of the race, especially since schools have been the main focus of DeSantis’ policy and political agenda. Democrats have been hyper-critical of DeSantis as he has worked to remake Florida’s education system, including championing legislation banning the instruction of gender identity and sexual orientation in classrooms up to third grade, putting intense scrutiny on the approval of classroom textbooks and hammering critical race theory, an academic philosophy that focuses on systemic racism. DeSantis opposes its teaching in state K-12 schools, even though it is not, and his administration <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/11/florida-has-paid-700k-to-teach-racial-inclusivity-00044828" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;has paid $700,000 &quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/11/florida-has-paid-700k-to-teach-racial-inclusivity-00044828&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf95a0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf95a0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">has paid $700,000 </a>to a firm that as part of its business model teaches governments how to incorporate CRT.</p> <p>In addition to his focus on education as governor, DeSantis is the first governor in state history to get heavily involved in local school board races, which are nonpartisan by law. At least 20 of 30 DeSantis-backed school board candidates won their Tuesday night contests.</p> <p>Education issues have energized Republican voters, so the party is eager to highlight them in the governor’s race.</p> <p>“Charlie Crist’s lieutenant governor pick is as tone deaf as the Democratic message here in Florida,” said Evan Power, an official with the Republican Party of Florida. “Somehow, he thinks picking a union boss who once compared parents to armed monsters will help him with the voters of Florida.”<br></p>]]>

However, officials caution that the deal is only one piece of a move to prevent some 200 companies from being kicked off U.S. exchanges.</p> <p>“The real test will be whether the words agreed to on paper translate into complete access in practice,” PCAOB Chair Erica Williams said in a statement, adding that the agreement has “no loopholes and no exceptions.”</p> <p>Washington and Beijing have been at odds for years over the PCAOB’s inability to inspect the auditing of China- and Hong Kong-based companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.</p> <p>Since the early 2000s, the U.S. has required all publicly traded companies to provide the PCAOB with the ability to inspect their auditors. But China and Hong Kong have long resisted the calls, often on the grounds of national security concerns.</p> <p>In 2020, U.S. lawmakers moved to force Beijing’s hand with the passage of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. The law, passed following a rare show of bipartisanship in Washington, effectively started the clock ticking on China and the U.S. to reach an agreement to allow for the PCAOB to inspect the audits. Under the law, companies that are found to not have allowed the PCAOB complete access for three straight years would risk being kicked off U.S. exchanges.</p> <p>“Foreign companies operating on U.S. markets should be held to the same standards across the board,” said Sen. <a href="https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51658" data-person-id="51658" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1661528799311,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-20e0-de27-a5f7-3fe734a90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1661528799311,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-20e0-de27-a5f7-3fe734a90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;51658\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51658\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Sen.

And the pressure only mounted in August, when five of China’s largest state-owned firms unveiled plans to <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2022/08/us-fight-for-audit-transparency-from-china-firms-sets-off-another-round-of-delistings-00051383" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;voluntarily delist&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2022/08/us-fight-for-audit-transparency-from-china-firms-sets-off-another-round-of-delistings-00051383&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf95d0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf95d0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">voluntarily delist</a> from the New York Stock Exchange. But the two sides were ultimately able to come together to reach the terms of Thursday’s agreement.</p> <p>In a statement, the China Securities Regulatory Commission called the agreement “an important step forward by regulators in China and the U.S. towards resolving the audit oversight issue that concern mutual interests, and lays the foundation for proactive, professional and pragmatic cooperation of the next stage.”</p> <p>Still, U.S. regulators caution that the deal is only part one of averting an additional wave of delistings from New York. If the PCAOB cannot “inspect and investigate completely audit firms in China,” Gensler said Thursday that China-based issuers are still at risk of facing trading prohibitions on their U.S. securities.</p>]]>

But Moderna said it is seeking damages for revenue Pfizer and BioNTech made from U.S. sales as of March 8, when it updated its pledge not to enforce any patents pertaining to Covid during the pandemic, and from the domestic manufacture of doses for other countries outside the Covax bloc.</p> <p>Moderna alleges that Pfizer infringed on two key components of its patented mRNA technology platform: the mRNA chemical modification first developed by Moderna scientists and encoding the full spike protein into the vaccine, a design Moderna says was based on its earlier coronavirus research. The lawsuit is based on three patents Moderna filed between 2011 and 2016, long before the company partnered with the National Institutes of Health to test and develop its Covid vaccine.</p> <p>"We believe that Pfizer and BioNTech unlawfully copied Moderna's inventions, and they have continued to use them without permission," said Moderna Chief Legal Officer Shannon Thyme Klinger. Outside of 92 low- and middle-income countries that could obtain Covid vaccines through the Covax program, “Moderna expects Pfizer and BioNTech to compensate Moderna for Comirnaty®'s ongoing use of Moderna's patented technologies.”</p> <p>The three companies have dominated the Covid-19 vaccine market over the course of the pandemic. They secured emergency use authorizations from the FDA within a week of each other in December 2020, though Pfizer and BioNTech were first. Both vaccines boasted efficacy rates north of 90 percent against the original coronavirus strain.</p> <p>The FDA first issued a license to Pfizer and BioNTech for their Covid vaccine, marketed as Comirnaty, for individuals 16 and older in August 2021. The agency approved Moderna's vaccine, dubbed Spikevax, for adults on Jan. 31.</p> <p>Moderna “made clear that while it would never enforce its patents for any COVID-19 vaccine used in the 92 low- and middle-income countries in the GAVI COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC 92), Moderna expected companies such as Pfizer and BioNTech to respect its intellectual property rights and would consider a commercially reasonable license should they request one for other markets,” the company said in a statement. “Pfizer and BioNTech have failed to do so.”</p> <p>Pfizer projects it'll make $32 billion in revenue from its Covid vaccine in 2022 and many tens of billions more from unrelated products. Meanwhile, Moderna made nearly $11 billion in revenue in the first half of 2022 and is projected to make another $21 billion in sales from advance purchase agreements delivered this year, but Spikevax is the company's only approved product. </p> <p>“Pfizer/BioNTech has not yet fully reviewed the complaint but we are surprised by the litigation given the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer," Pfizer spokesperson Sharon Castillo said. "We remain confident in our intellectual property supporting the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and will vigorously defend against the allegations of the lawsuit.” </p> <p>Moderna filed its suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The suit follows German mRNA vaccine developer CureVac, which in July <a href="https://y3r710.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fpro.politico.eu%2Fnews%2F151788/1/01020182da508f0c-6a88d341-027d-4989-bf36-88da85fd0024-000000/lu8mdVFxuTrreW9hpX9w12yGUYc=284" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;filed a lawsuit&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://y3r710.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fpro.politico.eu%2Fnews%2F151788/1/01020182da508f0c-6a88d341-027d-4989-bf36-88da85fd0024-000000/lu8mdVFxuTrreW9hpX9w12yGUYc=284&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9610002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9610003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">filed a lawsuit</a> against BioNTech for alleged patent infringement related to the manufacture and sale of Comirnaty.</p> <p><i>With a contribution from Carlo Martuscelli.</i></p>]]>

The spot warns that Vega once said only God can decide the life of the mother.</p> <p>"Yesli Vega cheered the Supreme Court decision overturning <i>Roe v. Wade</i>,"<i> </i>a narrator says in the ad, adding: "Yesli Vega is too extreme for Virginia."</p> <p>Spanberger was first elected in 2018 when she ousted Republican Rep. Dave Brat from his central Virginia seat. Redistricting left her in a seat that President Joe Biden would have carried by 6 points and she is considered one of the more endangered Democrats.</p> <p>The initial buy, backed by nearly $560,000, will run from Friday to Sept. 5 on broadcast and cable in the Washington, D.C. and Charlottesville, Va. markets. The incumbent has a staggering $4.9 million in her war chest as of July. Vega had less than $250,000.</p> <p>Spanberger joins a handful of vulnerable Democratic women who have aired TV ads on abortion rights since the Supreme Court overturned <i>Roe v. Wade </i>and erased the constitutional right to an abortion. Reps. Kim Schrier (D-Wash.), Susie Lee (D-Nev.) and Cindy Axne (D-Iowa) have all messaged on the issue, as have a slew of candidates.</p> <p>Lee <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/24/house-dem-tv-ad-abortion-00042329" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;went on air&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/24/house-dem-tv-ad-abortion-00042329&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf962000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf962000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">went on air</a> almost immediately after the <i>Dobbs </i>ruling with an abortion rights-focused buy. But it wasn’t immediately clear how many Democrats would use paid advertising to stress their commitment to abortion access. Voters in Kansas declined to roll back abortion rights in a referendum earlier this month, in another powerful sign that moderates and independents did not agree with the ruling. Ryan’s triumph in New York only boosted that signal.</p> <p>The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has painted it as an issue that can juice up Democratic base voters and persuade moderates, especially after the special election on Tuesday. Ryan leaned heavily into abortion rights and beat Republican Marc Molinaro by 2 points in a district that backed Biden narrowly in 2020.</p> <p>“We see this as a powerful issue in swing districts, not the only issue — People still care a lot about the economy and inflation,” said DCCC Chair Sean Patrick Maloney. “But the abortion issue has changed the equation. There's no doubt about it. And we're seeing the impact more every day.”</p>]]>

Energy prices made the difference in July: They dropped last month after surging in June.</p> <p>So-called core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 4.6% last month from a year earlier after rising 4.8% in June. The drop — along with a reduction in the Labor Department’s consumer price index last month — suggests that inflationary pressures may be starting to ease.</p> <p>On a monthly basis, consumer prices actually fell 0.1% from June to July; core inflation blipped up 0.1%, the Commerce Department reported.</p> <p>Inflation started rising sharply in the spring of 2021 as the economy rebounded with surprising speed from the short but devastating coronavirus recession a year earlier. Surging customer orders overwhelmed factories, ports and freightyards, leading to delays, shortages and higher prices. Inflation is a worldwide problem, especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine drove up global food and energy prices.<br></p> <br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6311436757112" frameborder="0"></iframe> <br> <p>In the United States, the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index is less well known than the Labor Department’s consumer price index (CPI).</p> <p>But the Fed prefers the PCE index as a gauge of inflationary pressures, partly because the Commerce index attempts to measure how consumers adjust to rising prices by, for example, substituting cheaper store brands for pricier name brands.</p> <p>CPI has been showing higher inflation than PCE; Last month, for instance, CPI was running at an 8.5% annual pace after hitting a four-decade high 9.1% in June. One reason: The Labor Department’s index gives more weight to rents, which have soared this year.</p> <p>The Commerce Department also reported Friday that Americans’ after-tax personal income rose 0.3% from June to July after adjusting for inflation; it has fallen in June. Consumer spending rose 0.2% last month after accounting for higher prices.</p> <p>The Fed was slow to respond to rising inflation, thinking it the temporary result of supply chain bottlenecks. But as prices continued to climb, the U.S. central bank moved aggressively, hiking its benchmark interest rate four times since March.</p>]]>

The legislation isn’t actually a tax bill, but if enacted would ding the two top tech-media companies, Google and Facebook, for millions and perhaps billions of dollars a year that would go to the news industry.</p> <p>Klobuchar modeled her bill on <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/digital-platforms/news-media-bargaining-code" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Australia’s News Media Bargaining Code&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/digital-platforms/news-media-bargaining-code&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9670002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9670003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Australia’s News Media Bargaining Code</a>, which through a compulsory negotiation and arbitration set-up forces Google and Facebook to pay qualifying Australian news organizations (from both print and broadcast) about $150 million a year. The rationale behind the Australian shakedown and the proposed American one goes like this: News headlines and snippets on Google and Facebook have enabled the companies to convene mass audiences and abscond with billions in advertising revenues that were once the news industry’s near-exclusive franchise. This shift in advertiser preference from newspapers and TV to Google and Facebook has led to financial pain for many (but not all) news vendors. Given journalism’s high value as a public good, Google and Facebook must pay for the damage they’ve caused and help steer the news industry back to something close to the status quo ante.</p> <p>That’s the logic, at least. Though it might <i>seem</i> well-meaning, it also unfairly punishes one industry for the failures of another. And that’s not a recipe for good lawmaking.</p> <p>Few of us want the commercial tide to sweep the news business into the deep. Nor do many of us hold much sympathy for the over-rich, oligopolistic tech giants.

But the Klobuchar bill unjustly punishes the tech giants by making it prop up an industry that has largely failed to address its business problems and has been decaying for decades. It’s not clear whether these subsidies will restore the news business to health, and it appears likely that the act would serve as a prelude to direct government subsidies to save the news — another bad idea. Finally, the bill resembles a reparations package, which is unfair because the tech giants didn’t cause the news industry’s decline. They only contributed to it.</p> <p>It would be nice to blame all of the news industry’s problems on the tech behemoths, but the undoing of the newspaper industry began well before the web’s advent. <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/6/14/75-years-of-us-advertising" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1661436019385,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-86ac-dbe7-adc1-a7bc1adf0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1661436019385,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-86ac-dbe7-adc1-a7bc1adf0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/6/14/75-years-of-us-advertising&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d54d-dc2e-a3a3-dfefb4890000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Newspaper circulation’s per capita decline&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d54d-dc2e-a3a3-dfefb4880000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Newspaper circulation’s per capita decline</a> started in the post-WWII era, as did the industry’s share of ad spending, thanks to competition from radio and TV. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/newspapers/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Total advertising revenue&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/newspapers/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9670004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9670005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Total advertising revenue</a> peaked in 2005.

Google, which was founded in 1998, had the best ideas on how to sell ads in the space, and by 2012 its <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/google-now-bigger-magazines-newspapers-164314703.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1661436250148,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-86ac-dbe7-adc1-a7bc1adf0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1661436250148,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-86ac-dbe7-adc1-a7bc1adf0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/google-now-bigger-magazines-newspapers-164314703.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d551-dc2e-a3a3-dff735b40001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;ad revenue surpassed that of the entire U.S. newspaper industry&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d551-dc2e-a3a3-dff735b40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">ad revenue surpassed that of the entire U.S. newspaper industry</a>.</p> <p>The rise of Google and then Facebook did parallel the decline of newspaper revenues, but it would be a mistake to say one caused the other.

For better than a century, the ad business had followed the dictum attributed to department store magnate John Wanamaker, “Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.” Internet advertising deflated Wanamaker’s wisdom by making it knowable which half was wasted. Web advertisers could finally measure the successes of their campaigns and refine where to advertise next. The web also proved to be a bargain for advertisers, as better and better ad performance became cheaper and cheaper: Total advertising as a percentage of GDP dropped 25 percent between the 1990s and the aughts. Google also created new places to advertise, such as on games and on smartphones.

In the Google and Facebook examples, the two companies did two things. First, they almost completely divorced advertising from editorial or entertainment content, making web ads more like billboards than newspapers. Second, they transformed advertising from a wasteful, crapshoot business that ran campaigns in newspapers, on TV and on billboards with almost zero feedback on effectiveness into an efficient, targeted enterprise whose success could be measured instantly. The analogy isn’t perfect, but what Google and Facebook did to the ad industry was transformative, akin to what digital cameras did to Kodak and personal computers did to typewriters. The newspaper industry had the resources to create something like Google or Facebook but didn’t. The onus for missing what was coming should fall on the news industry, not Google or Facebook. The news industry never had an inherent right to advertising dollars. To imagine they deserve any form of reparations because tech displaced them in the ad marketplace is laughable.</p> <p>The newsies can lament their losses all they want, but Google and Facebook owe them nothing. Sustaining the news business is a worthy goal. But sending the bill to Google and Facebook is simply unfair.</p> <p>******</p> <p><i>Don’t miss&nbsp;</i><a href="https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/australia-pressured-google-and-facebook-to-pay-for-journalism-is-america-next.php" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<i>Bill Grueskin</i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/australia-pressured-google-and-facebook-to-pay-for-journalism-is-america-next.php&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9690000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9690001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>Bill Grueskin</i></a><i>‘s excellent feature from earlier this year on the mechanics of the Australian system.

Some want to throw up their hands and ignore the problem while others have turned to fear tactics and homophobia that our communities have struggled to move past. People are tired, angry and ready to move on. I get it.</p> <p>But being upset, focusing on missed opportunities and assigning blame isn’t the answer. And as with any communicable disease, the clock is ticking. We’ve got to work together to turn lessons learned from the Covid pandemic into a national response that works.</p> <p>As a nation, we must not ignore diseases as they spread around the world, because we know that viruses don’t respect political borders. We must demand that our elected leaders continue to make responding to these viruses a priority. It was alarming when Congress lost interest in funding our nation’s Covid response while the pandemic continued. And now, at a time when our underfunded public health workforce is exhausted, we must rally to confront yet another virus with monkeypox spreading throughout the nation.</p> <p>In responding to monkeypox we must be honest and transparent but cognizant of the risks and realities faced by LGBTQ Americans. We have already seen a resurgence of fear and hatred toward the LGBTQ community — fueling a stigma that can tie public health messaging in knots. Some worry that highlighting at-risk communities could lull others into a place of complacency, and that the simple association with the gay community could stoke acts of violence. The CDC lacks any reference to gender or sexual orientation <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/vaccines.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1661440539992,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-5abe-d1fc-ad7f-fefe76ec0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1661440539992,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-5abe-d1fc-ad7f-fefe76ec0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/vaccines.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d592-d7cf-a983-d797b5840001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;on its webpage&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d592-d7cf-a983-d797b5840000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">on its webpage</a> addressing monkeypox vaccination, but the data is clear: Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are currently at highest risk for becoming infected.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/62/b6/201658b4483e895f541a52c3474b/monkeypox-vaccine-charlotte-08625.jpg"> <br> <p>In North Carolina, our motto is “to be rather than to seem.” To me, that means get to work and continuously improve as you go.</p> <p>Before our first reported case on June 23, we were ready. We were prepared to test for monkeypox at our state lab, we gave guidance to healthcare providers and we planned for vaccine distribution. By July 6, limited doses of the vaccine began arriving and we had already set up regional vaccine locations around the state with local health departments. On July 14, we published a detailed response plan describing for providers, community organizations and the public our approach to testing, treatment, vaccination and sharing information.</p> <p>From the start, we were clear that data would drive our response and our message. We’ve published daily <a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/monkeypox" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;case numbers&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/monkeypox&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf96c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf96c0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">case numbers</a> on our website, and as soon as we had sufficient numbers to protect privacy, we published demographic information about cases and vaccines. On Aug. 10, we released one of the first <a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/media/17508/open" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;equity analyses&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ncdhhs.gov/media/17508/open&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf96c0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf96c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">equity analyses</a> in the nation, finding that while 70 percent of monkeypox cases in North Carolina were in Black men, less than a quarter of vaccines had gone to Black individuals. Our report offered key actions we and our partners in North Carolina are taking to improve, like working with party promoters to have vaccination events onsite.</p> <p>As North Carolina’s state health secretary, I care deeply about protecting people’s health. And to me, this is also personal.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/e4/b9/af0a18e14690adb55d4934b1de0f/monkeypox-vaccine-charlotte-08401.jpg"> <br> <p>Here are the five things we need most right now in our national response:</p> <p>First, data must drive the response. Anyone can get monkeypox, but right now nearly all cases are in men who report recent sexual contact with men. That’s why we must prioritize the MSM community, especially with the limited vaccine supply, while using empathetic messages to help destigmatize the disease.</p> <p>As we organize our operational response, it is non-negotiable for state health departments to collect and share detailed demographic data with the public, so that we can understand the impact on different communities and close equity gaps.</p> <p>Second, state and local health departments must partner with LGBTQ organizations to organize outreach to MSM, share information, answer questions and provide vaccines — fast. The city of Charlotte, the epicenter of North Carolina’s outbreak, celebrated Pride last weekend. I’m proud that we muscled together a partnership to deliver vaccines at the event, with support from all levels of government along with local organizations. This strategy can be replicated at other events and locations that serve the LGBTQ community.</p> <p>Third, more is needed from health care providers. Medical professionals should test anyone with unexplained sores or lesions, including those from outside the MSM community, so we can stay ahead of the spread of this virus. Providers should educate themselves about appropriate infection control protocols and navigate them with empathy and care for the patient, just as they would with other infectious diseases, such as strep throat. When a patient has monkeypox, be persistent to work through the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/obtaining-tecovirimat.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;current federal process&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/obtaining-tecovirimat.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf96c0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf96c0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">current federal process</a> to get treatment. And finally, to help get folks vaccinated faster, providers and clinics serving the MSM community can go through their medical records and proactively reach out to their patients eligible for the vaccine and offer them advice.<br></p> <br> <p>Access to vaccines needs to be fast, easy and confidential. Appointment scheduling must be online, not just by phone. Clinics must co-locate with other routine health services, so no one knows why someone is in line. Instead of asking a long list of invasive vaccine eligibility questions, just ask: “Considering all the criteria, do you qualify?”</p> <p>Fourth, while I’m encouraged that the federal government has declared monkeypox a public health emergency and assembled an experienced team to lead a national response, there are additional steps that the federal government needs to take. Start with cash. Making existing CDC Covid funding and FEMA disaster dollars available for monkeypox will allow states and localities to use the contact tracing and vaccine infrastructure that was built for Covid. HHS can issue a PREP Act emergency declaration to get pharmacists ready to vaccinate. We must also develop new test collection methods to move past painfully swabbing lesions and make those tests easier to use in mobile spaces and less reliant on health care staff. And of course, we need to continue to increase the supply of vaccines.</p> <p>TPOXX, an antiviral treatment for smallpox that is being used to treat monkeypox, can be very hard to get. I applaud the federal government for improving the process for obtaining it. They need to continue to tweak that process to make it easier for providers and patients to get it quickly. They must also work rapidly to build the data necessary to understand if TPOXX could be authorized for emergency use and deployed in normal channels. As long as the process remains cumbersome, many providers and patients will simply go without.</p> <p>Many people I know are scared, confused and being treated as diseases instead of human beings. People need help. Our workforce and healthcare system are tired and stretched. Our elected leaders in Congress need to refocus on bolstering our public health infrastructure. But we learned a lot over the past three years, and we have the tools and experience to successfully respond to this virus.</p> <p>For now, instead of playing the blame game, let’s get down to business.</p>]]>

By what logic is “borrowed money for college” a sensible standard for selecting the recipients of unprecedented public beneficence?</p> <p>The logic is uniquely American, and incredibly harmful.

Young Americans and their families are encouraged to save as much as possible and then assume whatever debt necessary — by a culture equating the practice with “investing in your future,” by policymakers offering subsidies to promote indebtedness and by colleges that cash the checks upfront while accepting no accountability down the road.</p> <p>But the narrative is wrong.

Rather, the implicit judgment seems to be that the nation must, having sanctified the borrowing, collectively assume responsibility for the result.</p> <p>The result is a dysfunctional system for financing higher education that has generated more than $1.7 trillion in outstanding student debt, representing many loans that were unwisely offered to and accepted by borrowers who now face untenable burdens and deserve some avenue for relief.<br></p> <br> <p><b>So what should happen?</b> Biden’s approach of simply erasing the debt treats the obvious symptom — the debt — in the quickest and easiest (and also costliest) way, while doing nothing to address the underlying problem.</p> <p>Instead, America should embrace the banality of the student loan as just one form of debt among many — chosen by some for purposes of investment, and by others for what amounts to conspicuous consumption, exploited by sellers of a product with variable quality. As luck would have it, America has a very good legal system for governing regular debt, complete with structures for managing risk on all sides, options for sellers to provide credit themselves if no one else will, and equitable relief for those who make commitments they cannot keep.</p> <p>The keystone is our uniquely lenient bankruptcy system. Unlike in most other countries, the typical American can go to court, declare himself insolvent, hand over some remaining assets, default on his remaining debts and return home to a house exempted from the proceedings. This choice is by no means an easy one — his credit score plummets and borrowing becomes more difficult and costly; friends and neighbors are likely to notice, along with anyone who runs a background check in the future; feelings of failure and accompanying shame are common. Thus, while Americans file for bankruptcy <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/2005/04/15/morally-bankrupt" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;far more frequently&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.economist.com/news/2005/04/15/morally-bankrupt&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9700012&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9700013&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">far more frequently</a> than Europeans, the occurrence is sufficiently rare that consumer credit remains widely available and affordable. The cost of bankruptcy is low enough to encourage risk taking and ensure that someone who truly needs a fresh start can get one, but high enough that most who can avoid it will do what they can to steer clear.</p> <p>This is the option that should be available to all student-loan holders.</p> <p>Continuing the desacralization of student debt, we should eliminate the labyrinth of government grants, loans, subsidies and guarantees that assert an open-ended public commitment to financing anything a university can think to charge for. Public support should come at the state level through funding of state university systems and at the federal level through a simple, means-tested grant that covers, say, 50 percent of the median state’s four-year public university tuition. Tying the grant value to the median state would prevent individual schools from extracting more money by raising tuition. Costs of room and board would be excluded. Young adults not enrolled in college do not expect the public to pay for their housing or food; neither should those enrolled.</p> <p>Where would students find additional funding for more expensive options? A private loan market would likely exist but, absent the guarantees and subsidies, credit would be scarce and expensive. Borrowers would tend to have limited credit history and few assets. Lenders would be poorly positioned to evaluate the likelihood of successful repayment. The prospect of discharge in bankruptcy would add further risk. These obstacles are features, not bugs. Loaning large amounts of money to teenagers with uncertain prospects and no collateral is a bad idea for lenders because it is a bad idea, period. Finding ways to make it sufficiently attractive to saddle those teenagers with the loans does no one (besides college administrators) any favors.</p> <p>Fortunately, institutions exist with the capital to finance all the necessary borrowing, the information to assess the wisdom of borrowing to enroll, the resources to help students succeed and the incentives to make the system work. Those institutions, of course, are the colleges themselves. Just as sellers provide financing for cars, capital goods and sometimes real estate, colleges should be expected to finance the education they provide. Instead of cashing tuition checks before freshman orientation has begun, and leaving the student to someday pay back a third-party lender, colleges should receive tuition from their students after the fact, when those students have been launched into careers that allow them to afford the payments.</p> <p>This shift would initially require institutions without large endowments to borrow working capital for providing today an education that would be paid for tomorrow. But most institutions will have sufficient fixed assets to secure the loans, and the federal government could play a role if needed in guaranteeing <i>that</i> financing — with default leading promptly to liquidation.</p> <p>Meanwhile, students who made the choice to borrow under the old system would continue to repay those debts if they can, and would have the option to declare bankruptcy if they cannot. Such bankruptcies would cost the federal government much less than Biden’s broad-based loan forgiveness, and would help the transition to a better system and mindset rather than Biden’s doubling down on the broken one.</p> <p>Colleges dependent on their own alumni’s future earnings to fund their operations would face a radically different set of incentives than today’s. They would have no choice but to structure their programs to be affordable, relative to the value they deliver. They would have no choice but to make admissions decisions on the basis of likely future success, rather than ability to pay upfront. And they would find it suddenly in their vital interest to ensure their students’ successful connection to the labor market and even to provide subsequent training opportunities.</p> <p>College administrators who say this model would not work are really just admitting that <i>their</i> models do not work, absent a nation entranced by their mystical incantations. Let them, not their students, suffer the consequences.<br></p> <br>]]>

But plenty of other countries have arrested, indicted or imprisoned their current or former leaders, and it’s not a mark against their health as a democracy. Quite the contrary.</p> <p>The evidence shows that free countries — those that have strong records of protecting political rights and civil liberties — are just as likely to hold their current and former leaders accountable as unfree countries. In fact, such moves are slightly more likely to make countries freer than less free, as well as enable free countries to keep their republic intact.</p> <p>That’s the clear conclusion from a review of 243 cases from 1972 through 2021, where current or former chief executives have been arrested, indicted or imprisoned. These include presidents, premiers and prime ministers, as well as even emperors and monarchs. My students and I looked at a <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Freedom House dataset&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9740004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9740005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Freedom House dataset</a> to see if the country was considered free, partly free, or not free at the time of the arrest, indictment and imprisonment. We then looked at whether the country’s freedom level designation changed within five years of the arrest (except for cases originating after 2020).<br></p> <br> <p>Of the 243 cases since 1972, 74 involved a free state that sought to hold a current or former leader accountable in the judicial system. In 76 other situations, a “not free” state arrested, indicted or imprisoned a former leader or current occupant. In the remaining 93 cases, it was a partly free country whose government pursued an existing or ex-leader on a legal charge. As that breakdown makes clear, legal action has taken place across the board.</p> <p>Finally, our data also underscores that holding leaders accountable does not send a country spiraling downward. Within five years of legal action toward a current or former leader, the country kept the same freedom designation in most cases (185 times). In 31 additional examples, the country actually became freer. In the remaining 27 scenarios, the country became less free, with 13 cases resulting in a country temporarily losing its free designation. More than 80 percent of free countries maintained their threshold even after judicially detaining a current or former leader.</p> <p>For perhaps the best comparison to the United States, we can take a more in-depth look at the most developed countries, those that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That offers 27 cases to examine — and of these, only two OECD countries became less democratic within five years of arresting a current or former head of state: Mexico and Turkey.</p> <p>Here are a few of the key examples in which OECD countries took legal action against their current or former leaders:</p> <p><b>Colombia:&nbsp;</b>Ex-President Álvaro Uribe was ordered by Colombia’s Supreme Court to be placed under house arrest in August 2020 on accusations of witness tampering after he accused a leftist lawmaker of bringing false charges against him in 2012. Uribe was allowed to go free two months later as an investigation continued.</p> <p><b>France:</b> France has had two notable cases in recent years. Former President Nicolas Sarkozy was charged with corruption by French prosecutors in two cases after he left office and was ultimately convicted in 2021; he served a year in jail and another year under home confinement. Meanwhile, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon was charged with embezzlement in 2017; he was later convicted of fraud and misuse of funds and was sentenced to five years in prison, though after appeals, he eventually served just one year in prison.</p> <p><b>Iceland:</b> Geir Haarde, Iceland’s prime minister from 2006 to 2009, was indicted for his handling of the financial crisis and the collapse of Iceland’s banks. He ultimately was convicted for failing to hold Cabinet meetings during the crisis but was not sentenced to jail.</p> <p><b>Israel:</b> In 2016, Ehud Olmert, the former prime minister of Israel, was sentenced to eight months in prison over convictions of accepting bribes and obstruction of justice, though Olmert’s bribery conviction was partially overturned. More recently, Benjamin Netanyahu has been indicted for corruption though a trial has not concluded.</p> <p><b>Italy:</b> Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister of Italy, was convicted and sentenced to four years in jail for tax fraud in 2013. Because of his old age, Berlusconi was exempt from direct imprisonment and instead served his time by doing community service. But now he’s trying to make a political comeback, with a run for senator.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/20/fd/966f199d42a9b9b2411369d249c0/webp.net-resizeimage%20(14).jpg"> <br> <p><b>Japan:</b> Kakuei Tanaka, a former prime minister of Japan, was arrested in 1976 for allegedly accepting roughly $2 million in bribes from Lockheed Corp. He was found guilty of the charges in 1983 and sentenced to four years in jail but was allowed to remain free and the charges were eventually wiped away in an appeal. He remained one of the most powerful forces in Japanese politics even after the allegations.</p> <p><b>Mexico:</b> Luis Echeverría, a former president of Mexico, spent time under house arrest from 2006 to 2009 for his role in allegedly fueling the 1968 massacre of student protesters. Ultimately, the charges of genocide were eventually dismissed.</p> <p><b>Portugal:</b> José Sócrates, the former prime minister of Portugal, went to prison and then spent months under house arrest from 2014-15 on corruption charges. He is now awaiting trial for money laundering and falsifying documents.</p> <p>Other OECD countries with former leaders who have faced legal charges include Turkey, South Korea, Poland, Greece and Slovenia.</p> <p>As for the answer to the trivia question up above, the only U.S. president to be arrested was Ulysses S. Grant. In December 1872, Grant was caught speeding in his horse and buggy in the nation’s capital. He paid a $20 bond but didn’t show up in court.</p> <p><i>Karson Troth, Cooper Dolhancyk, Nicole Morales, Tamino Schoeffer, Emaleigh Turner and Katie Gonzalez contributed to this report.</i><br></p> <br>]]>

        <![CDATA[<img src="https://static.politico.com/85/22/bc94e209473991682ab6e752d152/ledefrost.jpg"> <br> <p><b>ORLANDO — </b>Tucked in a small strip of offices downtown, Maxwell Frost’s campaign headquarters shows all the frenzied signs of a primary Election Day rapidly approaching: marathon days with barely enough time to order takeout or run to the bathroom. Campaign flyers scattered on tables and shelves all throughout the office. A non-stop flow of calls to donors. Krispy Kreme donuts in the kitchen and an ironing board set up in the corner of a conference room.</p> <p>Here, in one room crammed with a couple dozen volunteers and campaign staffers, there’s a sense of both expectation and urgency. Maybe it’s the presence of two House Democrats who’ve flown in to drum up excitement now that early voting has begun. Maybe it’s the $1.5 million in donations Frost has racked up — far outpacing his more seasoned opponents in a race for Rep. Val Demings’s open seat. And maybe it’s Frost himself.</p> <p>At first glance, Frost looks like any other Gen Zer, zipping around the office, short curly ‘fro, khaki pants, multi-color sneakers and a black quarter-zip sweatshirt, occasionally dropping TikTok references into conversations. Then he slips into a blue plaid suit with tan leather shoes (the better to greet the Washington delegation) and smiles the casual, confident smile of someone who’s both well-versed in energizing a crowd — and unfazed by all the attention.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/48/50/1ce4a7ac4e8cbb3acf48978936c0/frostsecondary1.jpg"> <br> <p>It’s obvious he doesn’t fit the typical mold for a candidate for Congress — and he’s owning it. For starters, there’s his age, 25, the minimum to serve in the House. He’s Afro-Cuban in a state — and country — where a politician who is both Black and Latino is exceedingly rare. He hasn’t finished college, instead prioritizing his work in community organizing (abortion rights; gun control). He’s never held office. And he doesn’t come from wealth: When he’s not campaigning, he’s behind the wheel of his Kia Soul, clocking in hours for Uber to make ends meet. (His car is currently in the shop, which means he’s got even more time to devote to campaigning for Tuesday’s primary.)</p> <p>“It’s not just one politician that’s going to save us all. It’s not just one leader,” Frost tells the packed room. “It’s how we’re going to change Florida. And when I say ‘changing Florida,’ it’s not just flipping it red to blue… It’s about creating a society where we say, ‘Your success is my success and my success is your success.’”</p> <p>“That’s right!” someone shouts as the room erupts with applause.</p> <p>One of the lawmakers, Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, stands back, taking it all in. He made the trek from D.C. with Rep. Mark Takano of California to support the young upstart. This is, he says, by far the biggest gathering of folks he’s seen in any campaign headquarters this year.</p> <p>“That’s a good sign.”<br></p> <br> <p><b>It’s clear the lawmakers,</b> volunteers and staffers gathered here have all bought into Frost’s vision — and they’re committed to ensuring he wins the primary on Tuesday in this deep blue district, which would all but guarantee his path to becoming the first Gen Z and the only Afro-Cuban in Congress.</p> <p>And polling indicates that a win may be within reach. A new poll by progressive policy and polling group Data for Progress has Frost outperforming his Democratic primary opponents by double-digits, garnering 34 percent of the vote. State Sen. Randolph Bracy and former Rep. Alan Grayson, trail him with 18 percent and 14 percent of the vote, respectively.</p> <p>Here in this battleground state, where national headlines increasingly focus on two Floridians — former President Donald Trump and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis — Frost wants to chart a path for a new generation of politicians. And he’s convinced this is the place to do it.</p> <p>Volunteers, campaign staffers, local union members and other Frost supporters say he’s the future of the Democratic Party. They say he’s inspired them to get involved. They say they can’t imagine dedicating so many hours of work for anyone else. They say he’s the one to usher in a new political energy that Florida — and the rest of the country — so desperately needs.</p> <p>These days, says Cicilline, an 11-year House veteran, the business of politics “can really be discouraging. You look at what’s happening in Washington with conspiracy theorists and election deniers and you can get down and question, ‘Are we going to get through this?’”</p> <p>“But then,” he says, “you meet somebody like Maxwell … and it renews your belief in democracy and your hope for the future.”</p> <p>That’s a lot of hope and change to pin on a 25-year-old’s shoulders. But Cicilline isn’t the only political veteran heaping on the praise. Frost has racked up endorsements from dozens of major groups and leaders at the local, state and national level, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC (“a national leader on gun reform and abortion rights”) and the AFL-CIO. He’s also garnered the support of top Central Florida unions and local representatives as well as an <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/endorsements/os-op-endorse-frost-lowe-webster-congress-20220810-t7kel4qcsvh6tenuq4dhixni2m-story.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;endorsement from the Orlando Sentinel&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/endorsements/os-op-endorse-frost-lowe-webster-congress-20220810-t7kel4qcsvh6tenuq4dhixni2m-story.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9780000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9780001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">endorsement from the Orlando Sentinel</a>, which declared Frost “has made himself impossible to ignore, for all the right reasons.”</p> <p>But, in spite of all the money and endorsements, the ultimate question remains: Will the voters of Orlando back a baby-faced first-timer in a crowded race that includes a former member of Congress and long-time state senator?<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/aa/21/e928987143f783726dbc22172175/frostsecondary2.jpg"> <br> <p>Frost is betting yes.</p> <p>“I quit my job to do this. I drive Uber to pay my bills. It’s a sacrifice, to be honest,” Frost says. “But I’m doing it because I can’t imagine myself not doing anything but fixing the problems we have right now.”<br></p> <br> <p><b>He channels that can-do energy</b> as he joins five young staffers at an old wooden dining table with mismatched chairs, making a flurry of thank-you calls to donors on a recent night.</p> <p>Many don’t answer the call. Some hang up or tell him to get to the point. Others congratulate him for the campaign he’s running. In all, Frost keeps up the same high energy, determined to keep good relationships with donors and raise the money necessary to close out his campaign.</p> <p>“Hey! This is Maxwell Alejandro Frost, Democratic candidate for Congress in Orlando, Florida. How’s everything going?” he says, almost verbatim, on dozens of back-to-back calls.</p> <p>At the table, the chaos of the final days of the campaign — and the young team’s ability to multitask — are on display.<i>&nbsp;</i>Two volunteers are making calls simultaneously on their cell phones. The room immediately goes silent when someone asks Frost to jump on a call. They’re surrounded by piles of mail ads — both Frost’s and his opponents’ — laptops and empty water bottles.</p> <p>One volunteer talks about how he’s just a couple days away from starting his senior year of high school. Another talks about voting earlier in the day. One friend drove three-and-a-half hours from Miami to help out. Another flew in from D.C.</p> <p>His sister, Maria, shows up, her small dog, Cooper, in tow, sporting a yellow bumble bee harness. As Frost talks to a voter, Cooper’s high-pitched yelps punctuate the room. Everything is put on pause — briefly — to order sushi for dinner. It’s going to be a long night.</p> <p>Frost, who was adopted and grew up in a Cuban family, proudly shares his family’s story: His mother came to the U.S. as a child during the Freedom Flights from Cuba in the 1960s. She came with his grandmother Yeya and his aunt, with no money and just one suitcase between them. The family worked hard to make it in their adopted country, but it was rough. Today, his mother is a public school educator who’s taught special education for almost 30 years. (He doesn’t talk much about his father.)</p> <p>Frost attributes his love of music to growing up in his Cuban family, where he recalls waking up Saturday mornings to the windows flung wide open and Latin music blasting, knowing it was time to clean — a ritual in many Latino homes. That love of music carried into his middle and high school years, when he started a salsa band while attending an arts magnet school. It’s a little-known fact, he says, that his band, Seguro Que Sí, which translates in English to “of course,” played in the parade at then-President Barack Obama’s second inauguration.</p> <p>But, as he tells it, his decision to run for Congress comes from another part of his identity. Last year, amid news that Demings was running for Senate in an attempt to unseat Republican Marco Rubio, local organizers began courting Frost to run for her open House seat.</p> <p>Initially, however, he didn’t want to do it. Having worked on campaigns in the past, he knew a lot of the stresses of running for office.</p> <p>“And I just didn’t think it was my time,” he says.</p> <p>But that changed last July when he connected with his biological mother. In an emotional call, she told him she gave birth to him at the most vulnerable point in her life. She was battling a host of ills when she put him up for adoption — drugs, crime and poverty — systemic problems in need of real-life solutions, Frost says.</p> <p>“I hung up the phone and said, ‘I need to run for Congress.’”<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/5b/22/5696897249ad9bd24f69a6d57716/frostsecondary4.jpg"> <br> <p>His activist impulse started early. At 15, after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, he started organizing to end gun violence, getting involved in protests and knocking on doors. His resolve and commitment to that cause only amplified in the face of several mass shootings in his state: the 2016 shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, and the one at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.</p> <p>“We don't even have to let him know when we have a protest,” Curtis Hierro, senior legislative and political lead for Communication Workers of America in Florida, says to a group of about a dozen union members at the local union hall readying to go knock on doors in support of Frost. “Maxwell just materializes because you're part of the movement, you understand movement and it's what you live and breathe.”</p> <p>Frost held a host of jobs in field organizing for campaigns and causes before his activism attracted the attention of the ACLU of Florida, where in 2018 he worked on the fight to secure Amendment 4, which restored voting rights to over 1.6 million Floridians with felony convictions. Most recently, he worked as the national organizing director for March for Our Lives, the youth-led movement focused on gun violence prevention.</p> <p>“Someone the other day made the comment, ‘10 years ago, you were 15,’” Frost says with a hint of annoyance. “Yeah, I was 15 — and how sad is it that we live in a country where at 15 I had to be worrying about being shot at my school so I sprung into action?”</p> <p>“Hell yeah, I was 15 when I started my advocacy.”<br></p> <br> <p><b>In the lobby of </b>his campaign headquarters, there’s a large painting by Manuel Oliver, father of Joaquin, one of the students killed in the Parkland shooting. Against a bright yellow background are images of Joaquin and Frost along with a pointed message: “Time to save lives! So get on board or get out of our way!”</p> <p>If he’s elected, Frost says, he’ll be putting up the painting in his office on Capitol Hill.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/12/14/3969ca0f46a780bb8e799dbc1fcb/frostsecondary5.jpg"> <br> <p>Beyond ending gun violence, Frost’s platform centers on “the future we deserve.” In a mail ad, his campaign breaks down his priorities, priorities in sync with the progressive left: Medicare for All, safe streets and an end to gun violence, affordable housing, a living wage and 100 percent clean energy.</p> <p>Still, victory in Tuesday’s primary is not a guarantee. His biggest competition in the field of 10 candidates is Bracy and Grayson, who launched a last-minute bid in June after a failed bid for the U.S. Senate.</p> <p>The race has become increasingly messy, and in the final weeks, Frost has thrown a few punches.</p> <p>In a recent mail ad, Frost <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/2022-election/os-ne-politics-2022-election-frost-flyer-grayson-bracy-20220812-mvunau4tszfurg2auxbujasuse-story.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;directly attacks&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/2022-election/os-ne-politics-2022-election-frost-flyer-grayson-bracy-20220812-mvunau4tszfurg2auxbujasuse-story.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9790000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9790001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">directly attacks</a> them both: Grayson is “corrupt.” Bracy is “compromised.” Both candidates have pushed back; Grayson’s campaign said they sent Frost a cease and desist letter.</p> <p>“The things that Frost is saying about both Senator Bracy and me are patently false,” Grayson said in a statement to POLITICO. Frost’s ad, he said in the statement, is a “desperate move by a chronic liar.”</p> <p>And Grayson has a nickname for his young opponent: “Maxwell Fraud.”</p> <p>Frost, meanwhile, shrugs off the criticism, leaning into his differences.</p> <p>“I just represent a new type of politics,” he says. “I come from a different place. I’m not a lawyer. I’m not a millionaire. I’m an organizer.”</p> <p>And he’s tussled with top Republicans as well.</p> <p>In June, less than two weeks after the elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Frost was one of several activists who disrupted an Orlando event that DeSantis attended with conservative political commentator Dave Rubin.

It was at once violent and farcical, premeditated and shambolic, clearly associated with a coordinated effort by the outgoing administration to nullify a free and fair election it had just lost yet lacking the muscle of military or police authorities.</p> <p>So… was it an insurrection? A coup, albeit a failed one? A political protest gone awry? A pathetic show of white power cosplay or the portent of something darker and more dangerous in our nation’s not-distant future?</p> <p>Our inability to confront these questions reflects a long-held and deep-seated belief that our country operates outside the normal rules of history. Since the early 19th century, many Americans have embraced a providential understanding of the nation’s mission and destiny. This faith in the United States as the “last best hope of Earth,” as Abraham Lincoln put it, can create both a sense of purpose — a drive to correct the country’s imperfections, an aspiration to serve a beacon of light for all nations — and a set of blinders.<br></p> <br> <p>The oft-repeated assertion that “this is not who we are” — that Jan. 6 was an aberration — ignores a deep tradition of antidemocratic violence that courses through the veins of American history — from <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/november-07/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the mob that killed the abolitionist newspaperman Elijah Lovejoy in 1837&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/november-07/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf97f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf97f0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the mob that killed the abolitionist newspaperman Elijah Lovejoy in 1837</a> to <a href="https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/bleeding-kansas" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Bleeding Kansas in the 1850s&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/bleeding-kansas&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf97f0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf97f0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Bleeding Kansas in the 1850s</a>, from the Civil War itself to Reconstruction and Redemption,<b> </b>Jim Crow and the destruction of Native American nations in the service of building homesteads for free white people in the American West. This may not be who we are, but it’s most definitely who we’ve been.</p> <p>Put another way: What would we call Jan. 6 had it occurred in Argentina in the 1940s, Chile in the 1970s or Hungary in 2022? We’d not likely have a problem arriving at a definition. In this sense, the myth of national innocence can be a powerful drug.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/84/b9/d771feb440f5854f36f8cd3aa3f5/ap21028572334982-edit.jpg"> <br> <p>So what did happen on Jan. 6? To help answer that question, POLITICO Magazine assembled a roundtable of distinguished scholars and writers — Ruth Ben-Ghiat, professor of history and Italian studies at New York University; Ryan McMaken, editor of <i>Mises Wire</i> and <i>The Austrian</i>; Scott Althaus, political science professor and director of the Cline Center for Advanced Social Research at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; and Matt Cleary, associate professor of political science at Syracuse University — who specialize in the study of political instability and polarization, not just in the United States, but globally. Over the course of an hour, they came at that question from multiple disciplines, different regional and historical frameworks and diverse ideological viewpoints.</p> <p>If there is one takeaway from the conversation, it’s that we need to use a wider lens on Jan. 6 if we have any hope of understanding it. Our system of government is no more unique or less fragile than that of other countries, at other moments in time. To arrive at the right lexicon, we need to take the blinders off.<br></p> <br> <p><i>This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</i></p> <p><b>Josh Zeitz:</b> Ever since January 6, 2021, we have struggled to find the right words to describe what happened that day. Was it an insurrection? Was it a coup? Was it a protest that simply got out of hand? I'd like to ask each one of you what word you think best describes the events that day and why.</p> <p><b>Ruth Ben-Ghiat:</b> The night it happened I called it a coup. Technically, it is a self-coup — <i>autogolpe</i> — a lot of our coup language comes from Latin America and Spanish for reasons to do with the Cold War. This was an operation from the inside — somebody who’s already in power and wants to stay in power. And also an inside job in that 57 GOP officials were at the rally. The coup culminated January 6, but it's part of a thing that started in November and involved the elite of many institutions in the party. So that's why I call it a coup attempt.</p> <p><b>Josh Zeitz:</b> Ryan, I imagine you take a somewhat different point of view.</p> <p><b>Ryan McMaken:</b> Well, my view is that it is a riot in the sense that it’s difficult to attribute any particular goal to the people who were actually involved at the Capitol. I mean, certainly last I checked, 11 people were charged with seditious conspiracy. So that would imply that at least some people involved had some particular goal in mind.<br></p> <br> <p>But I just don't think there was enough critical support from inside the regime to support the idea that it was actually a coup. In fact, the data coming out from the January 6 panel suggests that Trump was delusional if he thought he had any sort of meaningful support outside of himself. I mean, even his own family members seemed unenthusiastic. It was actually Mike Pence who was communicating with the military and they were taking orders from the vice president, not even the president. Trump did not really attempt to call in any sort of real support from the coercive arms of the government. If you can’t count on the police, if you can’t count on the military to provide some kind of support or at least some other elite group that has real power within the regime, then that strikes me as something that’s not a coup.</p> <p><b>Josh Zeitz:</b> Just to poke, by that definition, was it a coup or insurrection that was unsuccessful, even though there was intent on the part of people participating in the riot and the president and potentially some members of Congress?</p> <p><b>Ryan McMaken:</b> Well, it was obviously unsuccessful, right? We could all agree on that. If it was just people on the outside who imagined they were going to take control of the government, that would have just been some sort of popular uprising — not a coup at all. Even if you had one or two people in the White House thinking that...but that's just such a weak reed to hang the description of coup upon that I just wouldn't use the term.</p> <p><b>Josh Zeitz:</b> Matt, with your lens as a Latin Americanist, how do you think of it?</p> <p><b>Matthew Cleary:</b> I guess I fall somewhere in the middle. Certainly, riot is an easy way to describe it. Insurrection is better, and I think insurrection would be my preferred term for it. And I agree with Ryan that “coup” is a little too strong, and there are some important differences between what happened on January 6th, on the one hand, and your typical Latin American coup on the other hand. The most important being the lack of participation of any military or police forces of the state. In fact, Trump the man, the person, could not or did not count on the support of any institutional actors, so far as I know. Not the Supreme Court, not the Congress as a whole, although certainly he has some supporters in Congress, not other important institutions of the state.</p> <p>The classic definition of a coup is the use of one part of the state apparatus to seize power of the state apparatus overall, and Trump just didn’t have that. The Latin American cases that I’ll describe to you all involved violence — a lot of violence. And the cases in which the incumbent president attempted to keep power, the <i>autogolpes,</i> as Ruth mentioned, also included substantial violence in use of force, and that just wasn’t the case here. Insurrection, I think, is more appropriate because at least some of those protesters on January 6 did have the intent, apparently, to force a change in the vote counting in a way that would change the leadership, that would change who would be president for the next four years.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/60/8f/715aba274f68b31f5756e130e439/ap19315601595761-edit2.jpg"> <br> <p><b>Josh Zeitz:</b> The distinction here is that a coup or self-coup involves state violence and force, but an insurrection is more of a popular attempt to effect regime change without the support of the state institutions?</p> <p><b>Matthew Cleary:</b> Yes. But it’s important to separate out two different things. One is the arrival of a mass of protesters to the Capitol building on January 6. That’s an insurrection, right? The second is President Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the election, obviously related to January 6, but as we’ve already said, that’s a process that started before and even went a little bit after January 6. In my mind, that’s a different thing, a different set of events, and we need a different word to describe that. That is obviously not an insurrection, so we’ll have to decide what to call that part of it.</p> <p><b>Josh Zeitz: </b>Scott, I imagine you come at this with a structural point of view?</p> <p><b>Scott Althaus:</b> The Cline Center that I represent is curating the world’s largest registry of coups, attempted coups and coup conspiracies, and we have a particular way of approaching this definition, but I think it’s important to first recognize that what happened on January 6 was a series of complex, interrelated events, not just one thing.</p> <p>Clearly protest or demonstration activity was part of what was happening on January 6. In contrast to Ryan’s use of the word riot, the Cline Center definition of riot requires an element of spontaneity. And in this case, we did not categorize the events of January 6 as a riot because there was clear evidence within at least some individuals and groups of planning. So that doesn’t meet our definition for a riot. We have a category called politically motivated attack, which this could be, and there are lots of kinds of politically motivated attacks.</p> <p>But in our definitions, this clearly meets the definition of an attempted coup. Our Coup D’état Project defines coups as organized efforts to effect sudden and irregular — that is, illegal or extralegal — removal of the incumbent executive authority of a national government, or in the case of auto coups, to displace the authority of the highest levels of one or more branches of government.<br></p> <br> <p><b>Josh Zeitz: </b>There is a deep-rooted place for violence in Anglo-American political protest. I’ve been thinking about the famous episode in 1765 when the Sons of Liberty, who we are taught to revere, literally destroyed the home of Royal Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson because they had several grievances against him. Remarkably, he later acknowledged the right of the mob to raze his home because it was a release valve — a legitimate form of protest. Is that how you’re thinking of the events of January 6, or was it something a little more serious than that without really a precedent in U.S. history?</p> <p><b>Ryan McMaken: </b>Vandalism is not good and breaking and entering to a certain extent is what occurred. But I would still say that the majority of people who showed up had no clear plan for what they were going to do. I do think some people did show up thinking now’s my chance to violently bring about some sort of change in policy in a big, dramatic way. Does that describe the group overall? I don’t think so. And I think that’s what would make it different from an event like what the Sons of Liberty would did, where there would be a lot of planning. Look at, say, the Boston Tea Party. There was a high degree of discipline among the people who showed up. Shays’ Rebellion occurred after months of planning, right? And of course, the intent was to attack an actual federal arsenal and seize weapons. So I don't think you can really compare that sort of event to an event where there's not really much evidence that people outside some small minorities within the larger hundreds of people who showed up to the Capitol that day had some particular plan in mind. Even with the release of data from the January 6 panel, I haven’t seen evidence of the level of planning that you would see from something like, say, John Brown’s raid. I think a lot of people were just along for the ride, but that doesn’t mean that there weren't some people in the group who could have acted violently and done real harm to both persons and property.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/d0/85/8c361c1d4db4bbbeceb31cab5fad/mag.Zeitz.Coupologists-USCoups.jpg"> <br> <p><b>Ruth Ben-Ghiat:</b> It’s convenient to focus on the QAnon Shaman and have this be just about rabble rousers. But all coups have to have buy-in from a broad mix of elites. You had all kinds of things going on with civilian elites and far-right groups.

It’s just not in keeping with American history that they were going to take out or kidnap Pence to stop him — that’s very coup-like.</p> <p>Finally, Trump wanted to enter the chamber and wanted to be there at the Capitol. With a coup, you have this moment where they pronounce the start of the new order — in Spanish, <i>pronunciamiento</i>. There were very strong indications that Trump wanted to be there, but he was prevented from being there.<br></p> <br> <p><b>Scott Althaus:</b> Different ways of defining different events will lead you to different conclusions. Within the Cline Center’s way of defining a coup-like event, we asked, ‘Did one or more groups plan to storm the U.S. Capitol?’ And there’s clear evidence that that was the case within this complex assemblage of individuals. ‘Did one or more groups intend to usurp congressional authority to certify the 2020 presidential election?’ Again, we see clear evidence that one or more groups did intend to do this. And for us, that satisfies our definitional criteria that there was an attempted coup that appeared to be motivated by dissidents.</p> <p><b>Josh Zeitz</b>: Dissidents?</p> <p><b>Scott</b> <b>Althaus</b>: We have a set of categories including military coup, dissident coup, rebel coup, palace coup, foreign-backed coup, auto coup and others. So an attempted dissident coup is a coup initiated by a small group of discontents to include ex-military leaders, religious leaders, former government leaders, members of legislatures, parliament and civilians, but does not include security forces or police as they’re organized arms of the government. And certainly by using that label, I am not trying to categorize in any sense the politics of people who are involved.</p> <p><b>Josh Zeitz:</b> The word dissident is something that we’re used to thinking about in connection with a different part of the world, so it’s interesting to see you use it in the American context.</p> <p><b>Scott Althaus:</b> This typology was developed for the other part of the world. In fact, I never in my life imagined that as director of the [Cline] Center, I would be overseeing a period where we would be classifying some event in the United States as an attempted dissident coup.</p> <p><b>Josh Zeitz:</b> So how should we think about this from a comparative standpoint? Matt, is there any parallel to this in recent or distant Latin American history?</p> <p><b>Matthew Cleary:</b> Let me go back to the distinction I made before between the insurrection on the day of the 6th and the broader effort to undermine or overturn the election.</p> <p>Protests like this happen all the time. We can go outside of Latin America and look at the Sri Lankan case from just a few weeks ago where thousands of protesters stormed the presidential palace and effectively removed the president. Those kinds of things are quite common there. There have been similar protests going on in Ecuador all summer. So insurrections, a violent protest against officers of the government, are quite common and there are lots of Latin American cases that would compare to what happened on the 6th.</p> <p>But the cases that we would call coups or attempted coups in Latin America are quite different. Again, they all involve the use of violence or force or the threat of violence and force. And they typically have buy-in from other powerful actors in the government, most commonly the military or the police. In the iconic coup in Chile in 1973, the Air Force bombed the presidential palace with the president inside it.

He had the support of military forces, he closed down the Congress and the Supreme Court at the same time, he had the military occupy streets in Lima to make sure that there wouldn't be protests. He followed that up with arrests and eventually found himself in jail for all of this. Those are very different events.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/f2/95/7bb3fb9d49bfa985a3a59ed355b9/ap22194538005384-edit.jpg"> <br> <p>So that’s part of the reason why I’m not really leaning on the coup side of January 6, because I see all those differences. And the idea that Trump would go to the Capitol building and pronounce himself dictator or something like that, that seems a little bit speculative to me.</p> <p>In Bolivia in 2019 and Honduras in 2009, incumbent presidents manipulated the election law to try to extend their stay in office. And they did so in a way that you couldn’t quite call a coup, but you would have to call it something like hardball politics. And both of those cases eventually failed because the incumbents didn’t have sufficient support among other powerful institutions in the government. And so they were removed from office. That’s directly comparable to what happened here. Trump did his best. Every political institution in the country said, ‘No, that’s not how we do things here.’ And so he was out.</p> <p><b>Josh Zeitz:</b> Let’s stipulate that a coup would require, as Matt pointed out, the use of state law enforcement or military power and violence. Are there examples of events that we would qualify as a self-coup or a coup where the people instigating it can’t necessarily count on the support of state police and military authorities, but have their own paramilitary forces at hand? We know that the Oath Keepers, Proud Boys and other white power militia groups were involved on January 6, so it could have gone another way had they been better armed and better prepared.</p> <p><b>Ruth Ben-Ghiat:</b> What’s so interesting and great about this conversation is it reveals that our language is in some ways insufficient to describe what happened. And that just as authoritarianism looks different today, so coups can change. The wild card about the U.S., which really is unique, is guns. There are 400 million guns in circulation. There are people with private arsenals. We tolerate militias, de facto paramilitaries, sovereign sheriffs. What other countries — democracies — have these sovereign sheriffs? Trump couldn’t get the military to help him. And so he’d been cultivating all these different extremists and giving them a big tent for years. And he was able to have a kind of bespoke thug army to converge. This is something that is possible only because we have a very different situation in terms of who can have arms and who can carry them in public and all of that. But we clearly need some kind of rethinking about what a coup can be in the 21st century, that it’s not one-size-fits-all. And so I am very glad about Scott’s Center that they're doing this taxonomy and classification.</p> <p><b>Josh Zeitz:</b> Is Germany an interesting counterpoint? In 1932, the National Socialists could not yet count on the support of the German army, but they could certainly count on their own paramilitary forces.<br></p> <br> <p><b>Ruth Ben-Ghiat:</b> Well, yes. And even before that, fascist Italy, it was a soft coup where the fascist party developed out of what we call militias — it was a decentralized militia movement and it gained control in local places, and then they staged a march on Rome. They marched 30,000 <i>squadres</i> at the capital, and it was a threat of violence to assault the capital. And that’s how Mussolini got appointed prime minister by the very timid king. So that was a soft coup, and that hugely influenced <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/germany/beer-hall-putsch" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Hitler, who tried his Beer Hall Putsch&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.history.com/topics/germany/beer-hall-putsch&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9800000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9800001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Hitler, who tried his Beer Hall Putsch</a> the very next year. So from the start, these authoritarian takeovers have looked different and it's again this language issue — what do we call these things?</p> <p><b>Ryan McMaken: </b>I would agree that the vocabulary is limiting in English to some extent and so you have to develop all of these tests of sorts of if X, Y, Z happens, then is it a coup? And if just X and Y happens, is it not?</p> <p>The media has not been helpful at all in the use of the language here. But I do think Matthew was absolutely right to bring up the 2019 crisis in Bolivia. I think that comes the closest to maybe something in recent history that’s very similar — you had a disagreement over who won the election. Both sides, in fact, were claiming it was a coup. So much of whether or not it was a coup comes down to when the military recommended to [President Evo] Morales that he accept the opposition’s win — was that a threat or not? Was the military really saying we’ll get involved and pick the next leader? Or was it not? And that’s a pretty small distinction, but an important one.</p> <p>Anytime there’s some sort of insurrection, some sort of disobedient act where any sort of violence or opposition to the state arises, there’s probably some people within that group who imagine themselves as taking control. But how much of that do you need to rise to the point of where you have some sort of organized insurrection? I mean, going back to John Brown, right? He imagined they were going to recruit all of these slaves and sweep through the nation, changing the nature of American government, and it just never happened. And so does that count as some sort of coup attempt? You could debate that as well.</p> <p><b>Josh Zeitz:</b> They hung him for treason against the state of Virginia.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/5d/f8/e494b1ea419a9b4a6b10a5029fd0/ap221024013-edit.jpg"> <br> <p><b>Ryan McMaken</b>: It was enough for his opponents to make that point, that’s for sure.</p> <p><b>Josh Zeitz:</b> I’m glad you brought up the media. Scott, you do a good amount of work on the relationship between the media and democratic institutions. Did the media’s coverage of the 2020 election and its outcomes in any way create the social unraveling that could have led to January 6? And second, is the media doing a good job right now in helping us to understand and frame the events of January 6th?</p> <p><b>Scott Althaus:</b> We live in this period of human history that I think is safe to say is unprecedented in the volume, velocity and diversity of different types of information that reach individuals through various mediated channels. So it would be almost absurd to say that media coverage in some form or another doesn’t have something to do with almost anything that we observe.</p> <p>The typical finding that we see replicated time and time again is that the information that people get through media of various sorts tends to reinforce the opinions and views and beliefs and values that they already hold. So if they come into a situation thinking, ‘I like the incoming president, I dislike the president's opponents,’ there’s very little that's going to come to us through media that is going to convince us otherwise. It is clearly the case in the United States that media coverage — and we could argue this going all the way back to the 1970s — has contributed to the polarization that we see in the United States today. But more important is the presence of political entrepreneurs who are willing to use particular kinds of messaging for political ends that aggravate these latent sentiments that people feel.<br></p> <br> <p>The second question about whether the media has done a good job — I think we see very consistent evidence that the American media has been struggling to understand how to responsibly report on a series of events that fall so outside the contemporary norms of American politics that the norms of professional journalism in the United States simply are not able to come to grips with that very easily. And there, I think American journalists have begun to look to places like Italy and South America for models of journalism within systems where the veracity of information coming from political leaders, where the motivation to try to polarize and outrage your constituents for political ends is more normal.</p> <p>The American media are in a learning period. And I think that learning period isn’t going so well, in part because the American media system is in an economic crisis right now. And so the attention economy requires highlighting the most dramatic, unusual, spectacular elements of whatever is going on. And that tends not to produce a calm, sedate, sophisticated kind of news coverage.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/ce/0a/0a7bb69047c7b0320f9079b94540/mag.Zeitz.Coupologists-Jan6Media.jpg"> <br> <p><b>Josh Zeitz: </b>The relationship between the right-wing media and the Trump administration was deep and it was hard to tell in some cases where one began and the other ended. You can certainly point to examples of left-wing media partisanship, but Joe Biden does not enjoy the sort of unwavering loyalty that Donald Trump commands from outlets like Fox and Infowars. Are there good examples in other places of media outlets lining up against democratic norms and institutions?</p> <p><b>Matthew Cleary:</b> In early 1970s Chile, obviously, there was no social media or Twitter or anything like that. But newspapers were quite polarized and the right-wing newspapers painted a picture of the communist takeover, Soviet takeover, of Chile that would spread through Latin America and played up all kinds of negative economic news. And Christian Democratic politicians, representing a centrist party in Chile at the time, published op-eds asking for the military to step in to solve the crisis. So again, that goes back to other points I’ve been trying to make about how about how coups require a kind of broader buy-in than what we see here. But, yes, the media environment, even in early 1970s Chile, just print media, clearly contributed to the sense of crisis, the degree of polarization and eventually the support, the active support, not just of a couple of elites, but of a third of the country. When the coup happened in certain neighborhoods, there were parades and celebrations and political parties had supported it as well — they soon came to regret that, but they supported it at the time.</p> <p><b>Josh Zeitz</b>: I wonder if some of the reason that Americans are having such a hard time getting their minds around exactly what January 6 was, and how to define it, was that we tend to think of ourselves as being a politically innocent nation where this sort of thing doesn’t happen. We’re not Germany or Italy in the 20s and 30s. We are not Chile in the 1970s.<br></p> <br> <p>Yet, as an historian, I could make the case that political violence is actually deeply rooted in American politics, from “Bleeding Kansas” to Reconstruction to the Jim Crow South. I could also make the case that we’ve been a very fragile democracy up until very recently; you could argue that we weren’t a functional democracy until 1965. Does our reluctance to look at the underside of American history feed our inability to understand January 6 for what it was?</p> <p><b>Ryan McMaken:</b> I think you see that a lot in a lot of columns that people are writing, people who try to appeal to nostalgia about how this country used to be united, and now there’s all these factions and people aren’t getting along like they used to. I’m not sure that was ever true, this idea that everybody used to get along or even shared a common religion. This claim is made as if the whole history of anti-Catholicism just never existed in 19th century America or something like that.</p> <p>And yeah, I would agree with you that a lot of these events, political violence, it’s downplayed and forgotten in a lot of cases. My grandparents came from Mexico, my mother’s side, so I look a lot into events like <a href="https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/plan-san-diego-1915/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the Plan of San Diego&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/plan-san-diego-1915/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9800002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9800003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the Plan of San Diego</a>, which occurred during the Mexican Revolution, where Mexicans were suspected of trying to start an uprising in southern Texas. And the locals totally freaked out and overreacted and just started slaughtering Mexicans in the borderlands in Texas, maybe 1,500 of them. Those sorts of things, they never get mentioned, right? The emphasis is on unity, that people generally get along, so I think people don’t have a language or a way to frame these sorts of events because they don't know about these sorts of events in our past.</p> <p>A perfect example is how after January 6 happened, you had a lot of people comparing it to 9/11 and Pearl Harbor. Now, I think you can not like what happened on January 6 while also recognizing that’s not really an appropriate comparison. But that seems to be the events that people know about.</p> <p><b>Josh Zeitz:</b> Scott, you noted that partisan media and media polarization have been growing since the 1970s. I could make the case that in antebellum America and Civil War era America, it was the same thing — Whigs and later Republicans read specific sets of news publications, Democrats read others. If you read the Democratic press in 1864 and their coverage of that election and the Republican press, you would think that Republicans were from Mars and Democrats were from Venus. Is it getting worse in your mind, or has it always been this way?</p> <p><b>Scott Althaus:</b> It’s not new. It’s unclear if it’s worse than in the past, because there has been very little systematic research that goes all the way back 240 years to assess levels of negativity. From the 1780s all the way through the mid-19th century, the dominant model of news coverage was a partisan model, an advocacy style of news coverage. The idea of an objective journalism wouldn’t come up really until after World War I and it wasn't the dominant mode of reporting in the United States until probably after World War II. But what came after the partisan mode and was competing with it for a long, long time is this kind of marketplace model of give people whatever they want. If they want silly stuff, if they want funny stuff — whatever entertains. And that model, along with the partisan press model, were the dominant ways that news reporting was produced in the United States up until the middle of the 20th century.</p> <p>So what we’re seeing today is in many ways a regression to the mean. We are going back to where we used to be, and the mystery then is why do we get this strange bubble that starts in the late 1940s and begins to decline very clearly in the 1980s where the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism — just the facts — becomes the thing that we expect. This is the outlier in our history, for sure.</p> <p><b>Josh Zeitz:</b> I’m going to ask for a lightning round in the end. POLITICO Magazine’s readers love to read history, political science and related fields. So I’d love it if you could each recommend one book or article that would help our readers inform their perspective on this topic. It can be a kind of micro-history or a case study or something more methodological, but something that, if they want to do a little more poking around, would help them.</p> <p><b>Matthew Cleary:</b> I’ll recommend a book called <i>Institutions on the Edge</i> by political scientist Gretchen Helmke. The book explains why competition and conflict between or among the three branches of government can produce these sorts of zero-sum dogfights in which actors can overreact and lead into a spiral that causes democratic crisis — not necessarily a coup, but democratic backsliding or erosion.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/99/9e/220bb08441ff8da994a2c99c7a9b/gettyimages-1230457172-edit3.jpg"> <br> <p><b>Ruth Ben-Ghiat:</b> I recommend Hannah Arendt’s <i>Origins of Totalitarianism</i> not only because it’s a very interesting period piece on Nazism and communism, but it’s full of observations on the workings of corruption — how all kinds of illiberal states get people to conspire and do their bidding — on propaganda and, of course, on violence. And so many of the observations transcend those two regimes, which are part of a very discrete historical era. I find it an evergreen text.</p> <p><b>Ryan McMaken:</b> A short book that people might enjoy is called <i>The Virgin Vote</i> by a historian named Jon Grinspan. It’s about the youth culture around your virgin vote — that is, your first vote when you were 21 years old — in this case the 19th century. It has a lot of information on low-level political violence like voter intimidation, the sorts of party competition that took place, and how people truly hated other people in the other parties and thought that if that other guy wins, the country is just going to fall apart and be destroyed. So it really helps to illustrate just how really deep and serious a lot of the political divisions were in the 19th century and how people experienced that on a daily basis.</p> <p><b>Scott Althaus: </b>The book I’d recommend is <i>How Democracies Die</i> by Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky. These are comparative politics scholars who assess the history of democratic backsliding through the 20th century around the world and draw lessons of how this backsliding happens, what are the warning signs, and then bring those back for lessons learned for American audiences as we try to continue this great experiment into the future.</p> <p><b>Josh Zeitz</b>: Fantastic. These are four excellent recommendations. I want to personally thank you for participating in what I thought was a fascinating roundtable discussion.<br></p> <br> <br>]]>

Instead, he chose to get out of politics altogether. By 2013, he was president of Purdue University, his official off-ramp from politics. Ten years and a political era later, Daniels has refashioned himself into a national leader on higher education reform; he famously held tuition at Purdue at the same price for that same amount of time. Now, his allies are urging him to return to politics — having just formed a PAC for him this week. But Daniels’ more moderate strain of conservatism — he floated the idea of a “truce” on social issues in 2010 — is an artifact of a bygone era of politics. If he were to return to politics, he would do so to a vastly different GOP: One that relishes the very culture wars Daniels once eschewed.</p> <p>In an exclusive interview with POLITICO Magazine, for the first time in a decade, Daniels dishes on the Trump era, which Republican Senator he most admires, why he thinks JD Vance lost his way, and why he thinks 80 is too old to run for president.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/06/22/153d7a274a7d8d521664401bef8e/gettyimages-140085290.jpg"> <br> <p><b>Adam Wren:</b> President Joe Biden recently signed into law the CHIPS Act, authorizing $280 billion in U.S. spending to subsidize computer chip companies and invest in technological research. You’ve spent a career lamenting government spending, but it seems like that kind of spending would benefit the mission of a tech-forward campus such as Purdue.</p> <p><b>Mitch Daniels:</b> As somebody who worries about the fiscal condition of the country, the bills that you and even younger generations are going to have dumped on them, I’m always dubious about any new spending. I was able to persuade myself that CHIPS itself was a responsible thing to do, given the centrality of semiconductors, as people say, almost like oil has been. An economy can’t be a world-leading economy without it.</p> <p>If President Xi decided he didn’t have to conquer Taiwan, if he just simply decided to shut off or blockade it or something, it would be more damaging to this country than almost anything else he could do to us. So, for that reason, and that reason only, I felt it was a responsible thing.</p> <p>I hope that’s not just a rationalization because some of that money is going to wind up here. [A new $1.8 billion semiconductor plant announced plans to open at Purdue’s Discovery Park in July.] It’s probably the biggest step forward for the Indiana economy since the Honda decision [to move to Indiana in 2006].</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> But it does sound like the final version signed into law had some extraneous spending items you’re unhappy with.</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> There always are. This is Washington. Nothing new to say. Washington needs to, at some stage, be thinking very resolutely about spending reductions leading to smaller deficits and ultimately to debt reduction or this country's going to have a genuine national security and economic crisis. I’ve said it many times. Admiral Michael Mullen said a few years ago the debt is the biggest national security problem worrying him looking out a decade or two or three.</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> I rewatched your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSAmkDUi4PQ" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1660869841030,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f751-d6b4-a7e5-f7d9bbd30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1660869841030,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f751-d6b4-a7e5-f7d9bbd30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSAmkDUi4PQ&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-b38e-dde2-af83-f3af86b30001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;2012 State of the Union response&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-b38e-dde2-af83-f3af86b30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">2012 State of the Union response</a> to Barack Obama recently. You talked about that debt threat in a way that seemed very imminent, and yet here we are, more than a decade later. Is there a point of no return?</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> Even then, I wasn’t suggesting it was going to happen tomorrow. But I tried to point out on many occasions, this is not a matter of somebody’s computer model speculating that a big problem is going to come, like climate change. This is absolutely certain. It’s mathematical. And it’s gotten so much worse. In the meantime, you say about the “point of no return:” In one sense, we’ve reached it, not in the overall societal sense. I mean, we’re still very fortunate. We’re still the world’s reserve currency. There are other places that have problems too. Right now, we’re the best house in a slum neighborhood.</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> Are you worried about the creeping threat of autocracy when you look at the sluggish nature of our institutions to confront big problems? To some, autocracy seems much more efficient.</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> Depends on what you want to be efficient at. Extinguishing individual liberty? Yeah, maybe it’s good at that. Not good at producing great opportunity and prosperity. It’s much more efficient for tyrants. This is really your question: Our system, some believe, is too rigged against autocracy, where it gets paralyzed. What bothers me more is the tribalism. I’ve been fretting about that in public and in commencement addresses for many years now. And it’s not gotten better. Once that sort of poison gets into the culture of a country, it’s not clear that there are words or deeds or individual leaders who can help people move out of it, move back toward a great sense of community and fellowship — national unity.</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> You do not talk about Donald Trump. You haven’t mentioned his name publicly in more than a decade. You have said you don’t know him, so you don’t talk about him. But if politics is downstream of culture, what happened in the culture that led to his presidency and to this current moment we find ourselves in?</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> That’s such a central question. I will say this: I think the last presidency — I’m not going to personalize it — I’d say the last presidency contributed to this but didn’t cause it. I think that was a symptom — that shocking outcome of the 2016 presidential election. I was surprised at the outcome.</p> <p>But to me, it was a symptom. And I think it’s fairly simple: What Lenin would have called the “commanding heights of the economy,” your businesses and places like higher education institutions, have become too detached from the lives and values of a vast number of millions and millions of, I’ll say, average Americans … I’ve got friends of mine who were mortified at the 2016 outcome, people who are passionate members of the Democratic Party who ask me, “How could this happen?” I said, “It’s not complicated. If you look down your nose at someone long enough, one day they will punch you in it.” And I think that’s what happened. I sat there that night — I don’t watch much television — but these national network commentators are talking to each other incredulously. <i>What happened here? Well, these under-educated types, you know, these are non-high school graduates </i>… Disdain is not too strong a word. It was condescending.</p> <p>I do believe that when you started the question with culture being upstream of politics, you were exactly right. I think the nature of our public discourse has had an effect. Social media is a disaster in this respect, along with declining attention spans. I think that’s where it started.</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> You think it’s a relatively recent phenomenon in American politics? I mean, re-watching your State of the Union response, it seems like a different era in American politics. You praise then-President Obama as a family man.</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> It’s very recent. Adam, stick with me: The first time I ran, I wrote a little message, and we used it in the Republican primary. And I said — almost verbatim — “I’ve never run for public office before, and before you vote you should know there’s a couple things I won’t do to win it. I won’t disparage an opponent’s background or character or motives. We’re going to ask for your support based on things we’ll do, not attack another person.“ And for the next eight years, the easiest applause line if I’m giving a speech somewhere is, “We’ve run elections and never made a negative commercial.“ Now that’s not that long ago. I still hope there’s room for people who will tell these mercenaries — which we never used — “Yeah, no. Thank you for your advice, but we’re not going to do it now.“ That’s probably naive. Because the advice from consultants now is, “You can play Mr. Nice Guy, but that will get you beat.“</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> Let’s tie those two strands together: What happened in 2016, and then what you describe as the elites sneering at everyday people, as well as the environment of today and negative attacks…</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> That’s your paraphrase. I was careful not to use too many of those kinds of words like ‘elites.’</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> Fair. But let’s talk about JD Vance, who was one of those people on television after 2016 explaining average Americans to a national audience. And in <i>Hillbilly Elegy</i>, he mentions you quite prominently, calling you his ‘political hero.’ He’s, objectively, doing those very things you caution against in his Ohio Senate race against Democratic challenger Tim Ryan.</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> It’s interesting you bring him up. I got to know him. He’s on the wall out there (Daniels motions to a photo outside his office). I brought him to campus when his book was hot. I’ve tried to bring all kinds of interesting people here. He and I had some good interactions. But not now for a good while. And so I noticed, as you did, that he veered in a different direction. And I wish I could say he’s the first friend or person that I’ve seen do that, but I could name a couple of others here in the state who I know are responding to political reality as they see it, or who someone persuaded them to see it — you know, <i>you got to do this to win</i>. I’m not in a position to say that that’s wrong. But I think it’s a little regrettable.</p> <p><b>Wren</b>: You once called former Indiana state Sen. Jim Banks, who joined the Senate in 2010, around the end of your gubernatorial career, the future of the Republican Party. He’s climbing the ranks of Congressional leadership now, championing the culture wars, and is a Trump acolyte.</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> There’s a little story about that. One of the maiden voyages of our RV was a hog roast up on a farm in northeast Indiana. That was on Jim Banks’ farm. He was the organizer. We probably only overlapped in the legislature a couple years. He was a person of promise and he certainly has been rising ever since.</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> Rising at the expense of the values of a Daniels Republican?</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> Now I’m going to take refuge in the fact that I don’t comment on partisan politics these days.</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> Indiana’s general assembly passed, and Gov. Eric Holcomb signed into law a near-total ban on abortion recently, becoming the first state to do so in a post-<i>Roe</i> country. Eli Lilly, Cummins and other companies have said they are going to expand<b> </b>elsewhere now. Are you concerned about economic harm to Indiana? Or even declining enrollment at Purdue from would-be out-of-state enrollees?</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> I honestly don’t know. I don’t know.</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> In 2010, you were critical of high school teachers using Howard Zinn’s book <i>A People’s History of the United States</i> in K-12 curriculum. Looking back, do you see the roots of the GOP’s current fixation on the so-called “woke curriculum” as far back as then?</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> That whole thing had nothing to do with higher ed or Purdue. I think it’s a completely different thing on this campus. Somebody wants to read him, teach him, that’s fine. Students are older. There's more than one teacher. There's more than one book. That's very different than what you’re peddling to a sixth or seventh or eighth grader, where a teacher’s word is law.</p> <p>Misrepresentation of American history and American values has permeated much of — not all, but much of — education now for a good long time. And so the people who imbibed that growing up very often are the people who are now teaching, running school boards and so forth. And so I think that this wasn’t unforeseeable, but I do think it’s very unfortunate, and should be pushed back against.</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> And when you say “should be pushed back against,” you're talking about the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives advanced by school boards in some districts across the country right now as well?</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> I thought we were talking about how our history and civic principles are taught. </p> <p><b>Wren:</b> Understood. A town in Michigan recently defunded its public library after trying to get LGBTQ-themed books removed. Are you concerned the GOP is veering too far into anti-intellectualism?</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> That would be unconscionable. Leave the party out of it, because I’m not sure it’s organized by a party. There’s a lot about our K-12 system that needs improvement. And one reason it’s very hard is that the education establishment stays put in place. Parents come and go. So parents have, in many cases, effectively mobilized to give us more choice, give us more quality, give us more safety, and sometimes had some effect, but all too often, their kids either leave the system or graduate, and they go away. And I think that in some of these matters you’re asking about, we’ve seen parents mobilizing. “What are you peddling to my child?” That is citizen activism of the highest order. That has nothing to do with closing libraries.</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> As governor, you sought to create a “better sandbox” economically in passing low taxes and de-regulating the state to incentivize companies to build their headquarters here. That approach has come under fire.

Hicks, the Ball State University economist, <a href="https://www.fwbusiness.com/opinions/article_ebedf570-a76f-594f-9fa6-85667c78916d.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1660870473522,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f751-d6b4-a7e5-f7d9bbd30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1660870473522,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f751-d6b4-a7e5-f7d9bbd30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.fwbusiness.com/opinions/article_ebedf570-a76f-594f-9fa6-85667c78916d.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-b398-dabd-ad8f-b3b82a410001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;wrote recently&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-b398-dabd-ad8f-b3b82a410000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">wrote recently</a> that it’s “been the worst two decades in the state’s economic history, and that prospects for the next two decades are even poorer.” That’s quite an indictment of your approach. Indiana’s personal per capita incomes have declined.</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> Professor Hicks generally does good thinking. It’s just totally misguided, and basically, the fundamental flaw is nobody ever said that this “better sandbox” would solve every problem for all time. It was necessary but not sufficient. The right way to look at it is, if you hadn’t done that, we’d be in disastrously worse shape. Ten years ago, I was giving speeches that said “All right, a better tax regime: check. A better litigation regime: check. Better regulation, better infrastructure: We’re now number one in the country every year, it seems like. But until we can check the talent box, we haven’t got this thing solved. And we haven’t checked the talent box. I’m not faulting anybody, but it’s the hardest problem to deal with. But to say the rest of it wasn’t wise, I think is colossally and provably untrue. Critics don’t correct for the cost of living. Your dollar goes a lot further here. And so just simply looking at income levels doesn’t answer the question. Sometimes they don’t correct for disposable income. What matters is how much the family has in its checkbook after they pay their taxes. I think it’s a dead-end argument.</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> There don’t seem to be a lot of governors following your model these days — in terms of avoiding the culture wars.</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> Governors of either party have always tended to be more pragmatic and practical. You don’t have a choice. It’s not all about a snappy soundbite. People in Washington think they get off a clever tweet and they had a good day’s work, right? And so I’m not certain that’s changed in a big way.</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> When you look across the national landscape at political talent, are there young leaders in America who excite you?</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> [Nebraska Senator] Ben Sasse.</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> What about Ben Sasse?</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> He’s thoughtful. He’s in it for the right reasons. I fear that people like that may be discouraged by the difficulties we have and go find something else to do. He speaks for himself. He writes for himself. I always thought that was an important mark of a public servant.</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> A lot of pro-impeachment Republicans have been driven from office. What does that mean for the future of public service?</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> I’ll just say it this way: I think this is pretty symmetrical. I think you’re seeing people who have somewhat more moderate or mixed views driven out or taken out on both ends. Look at the left end of the spectrum to people very purposefully going after folks who don’t agree with the most extreme version of today’s left-lane politics. So that’s not good. It’s pretty symmetrical on both sides.</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> But do you think the outcomes have been symmetrical? Looking at January 6, for example — the left didn’t storm the Capitol.</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> Well, that was a singular event. Awful and inexcusable. Indefensible. But I think I see people on the other end who have, in different ways — riots, and so forth — behaved in a way that’s inimical to free institutions. It just wasn’t their president who got beat. You can’t imagine a worse assault on institutions than the January thing, but I’m not sure it reflects anything particularly different than I see on the polar-opposite side.</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> Closer to home, your friends have circulated your name as a possible 2024 gubernatorial candidate. You’ve said you haven’t thought about it. You’ve said you’re focused on Purdue. But what you haven’t said is “no.”</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> I haven’t said anything. I don’t comment on things I haven’t thought about.</p> <p><b>Wren:</b> I’m giving you a chance to think about it right now.</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> [Laughs.] No, I don’t have anything to say about it.</p> <p><b>Wren: </b>Will you have an active role in supporting whoever the 2024 Republican presidential candidate is?</p> <p><b>Daniels:</b> We talked about how these things have gotten more nasty, toxic, and it’s been comfortable to be able to duck questions the way I’ve been ducking yours. So I don’t know. I don’t have a plan for what’s next. Because you do all your homework, I have not lived all my life around politics. The longest job I ever had was at Eli Lilly. I learned all the most important lessons in the private sector. When we were in public life, I said over and over again that I wasn’t much of a fan of careerists in politics. I’ve resisted it now for 10 years. And so I don’t feel particularly drawn or even obliged to go back into that.

Even the normally staid congressional news site Roll Call covered the phenomenon in 2020, saying — sorry — that “<a href="https://rollcall.com/2020/02/12/everyone-has-a-podcast-now-including-rep-dan-crenshaw/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Congress wants to get into your earholes&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://rollcall.com/2020/02/12/everyone-has-a-podcast-now-including-rep-dan-crenshaw/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98b000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98b000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Congress wants to get into your earholes</a>.” Some of them are even quite successful: “Verdict with Ted Cruz,” co-hosted with the right-wing gadfly Michael Knowles, consistently ranks among Apple’s top news podcasts, as does the offering from his similarly loquacious former fellow senator, “The Al Franken Podcast.”</p> <p><a href="https://c.tenor.com/pZk126jdQBQAAAAC/review-andy.gif" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;But are they any good?&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://c.tenor.com/pZk126jdQBQAAAAC/review-andy.gif&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98b0010&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98b0011&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">But are they any good?</a> As POLITICO Magazine’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/10/30/ruthless-podcast-josh-holmes-politics-review-conservative-517702" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;de facto podcast critic&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/10/30/ruthless-podcast-josh-holmes-politics-review-conservative-517702&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98b0012&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98b0013&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">de facto podcast critic</a> and somewhat of a guilty and reluctant addict of the medium myself, I set out to answer that question for you, dear reader, with a single-minded dedication: I spent an entire day, from the moment I opened my eyes to the moment at the end of the day when I stepped off the subway in my neighborhood and waved the white flag, consuming nothing but podcasts hosted by our democratically elected representatives. By my calculation I listened to 583 minutes of podcasting in a single day, or nearly 10 hours of programming.</p> <p>I do not recommend that you do this.</p> <p>The experience was not entirely without moments of joy or curiosity — although the extent to which this might be ascribed to <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22387-stockholm-syndrome" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Stockholm syndrome&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22387-stockholm-syndrome&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98b0014&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98b0015&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Stockholm syndrome</a> would require a trained professional to determine — but overall it was characterized by a crushing, mind-melting <i>boredom</i>. To understand why, first consider what makes podcasts enjoyable: an easy group candor and spontaneity, or a deeply specific subject matter expertise, or a willingness to ask trenchant, provocative, uncomfortable questions. In other words, everything an office-holding politician is <i>not&nbsp;</i>incentivized to do.</p> <p>Still, the incentives for politicians to record these shows — to ingratiate themselves with voters, to simply try something new, to give interns a flashy media project to put on their resumes — are obvious. But they fail as entertainment because they’re at odds with the strengths of the medium itself. The most successful podcasters accomplish something that politicians cannot, no matter how hard they try: to be so consistently idiosyncratic, so personal (and personable) in their approach, that the listener develops a peer-like relationship with them, if only in their mind. To hear politicians try to do this is to better understand how they’re pulled by trend, ambition or mere curiosity toward means of communicating with voters that simply <i>don’t work</i>, and how they fundamentally misunderstand their role in creating the sense of community and social identity that podcasts engender.</p> <p>Some of the greatest politicians in American history have been our most effective communicators, but the medium is at uniquely cross purposes with the role (and electoral demands) of a political leader. Which means that unless <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/08/15/stan-cuomosexual-yanggang-harris-khive-504436" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the office-holder you “stan”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/08/15/stan-cuomosexual-yanggang-harris-khive-504436&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98b0016&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98b0017&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the office-holder you “stan”</a> happens to be dropping new episodes on a weekly basis, there are very few non-academic reasons to tune in to these programs. To find out why, join me in these dog days of summer on a journey to the center of audio boredom, where we will learn about retinal implants, the relative merits of Robert Pattinson as Batman, a <i>lot&nbsp;</i>about the Detroit FBI field office for some reason and, hopefully, a little bit about the strange new media incentives that govern our politics.<br></p> <br> <p><b>To start my journey,</b> I figured: Why not begin at the top, with the best, or at the very least most crowd-pleasing, America’s democratically elected representatives have to offer? It should be noted here that, in keeping with overall media trends that date back to the creation of political talk radio itself, the most successful podcasts by <i>sitting</i> office-holders are uniformly hosted by Republicans. As of this writing, not a single Democratic office-holder pops up on the top “news” charts published by Apple, Spotify or industry-tracking site Chartable, while Cruz and his fellow Texan Rep. Dan Crenshaw consistently rank in the top 100 (with an occasional cameo from Rep. Matt Gaetz, effectively more a media member than a politician).</p> <p>True to right-wing media form, the first thing that greeted me when I pressed “play” on Cruz’s “Verdict” was the insistently cheerful voice of Liz Wheeler, the <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/04/27/the-new-conservative-media-establishment-218107/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;former One America News Network host&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/04/27/the-new-conservative-media-establishment-218107/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98b0018&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98b0019&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">former One America News Network host</a> and Cruz’s fellow podcaster on the conservative <a href="https://soundfront.com/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Soundfront network&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soundfront.com/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Soundfront network</a>, imploring listeners to invest in gold and silver with their sponsor as a hedge against inflation. If you’ve done your time in the conservative media trenches, it’ll feel just like coming home.</p> <p>“Verdict” has a bone-simple structure, executed with high professionalism: Knowles, the <i>Daily Wire&nbsp;</i>podcaster and <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Reasons-to-Vote-for-Democrats/Michael-J-Knowles/9781501180125" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;professional troll&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Reasons-to-Vote-for-Democrats/Michael-J-Knowles/9781501180125&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">professional troll</a>, tosses up the day’s outrage chum for Cruz to leap out of the water and sink his teeth into, <i>Free Willy</i>-style, delivering the same kind of lawyerly stemwinders about the evils of Democrat rule that he’s prone to launch into on the Senate floor when the cameras are rolling.</p> <p>If there’s an interesting dynamic it’s in hearing Cruz walk the tightrope between affirming his outrage at the conspiratorial, <a href="https://www.revolver.news/2022/08/jan-6-pipe-bombers-mechanical-timer-detonates-fedsurrection-lie/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;deep-fever-swamp content&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.revolver.news/2022/08/jan-6-pipe-bombers-mechanical-timer-detonates-fedsurrection-lie/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">deep-fever-swamp content</a> in which Knowles is clearly steeped and his desire to remain a somewhat mainstream politician (and presumably credible presidential contender), something of which he mostly acquits himself well — although one tirade about the perceived iniquity of that FBI field office in Detroit seriously tests the listener’s patience.</p> <p>And occasionally, something like an actual conversation does break out: One recent episode ends with a casual aside about Texas barbecue in response to a listener question, where Cruz admits to his modest grilling skills before accepting an inexplicable compliment from Knowles about how “manly” it is to simply make a dinner reservation instead.</p> <p>Overall the experience was about as enjoyable as you would imagine it would be to listen to Ted Cruz speak for three straight hours. So I moved on to his fellow Texan and chartbuster, Rep. Dan Crenshaw, and the contrast was immediate: Instead of a pump-up-the-base outrage hour, “Hold These Truths” is a mellow, chatty interview program, where one episode will feature a Houston-area bioengineer describing advances in brain-machine interfaces like retinal implants that might ostensibly benefit Crenshaw himself. Another might feature Crenshaw’s buddy and fellow Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher gabbing about the CIA’s “<a href="https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/olj/sa/sa_jan02srm01.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;remote viewing&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/olj/sa/sa_jan02srm01.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">remote viewing</a>” experiments, or different “Batman” incarnations. It’s not unlike a decaffeinated version of “The Joe Rogan Experience,” a non-scholarly but deeply curious person trying in earnest to educate his listeners. That’s not to say that the program is utterly lacking in partisan or ideological content; it features plenty of slaps at Bidenomics and “wokeness.” But its lack of stridency and Crenshaw’s easy nature made it the most enjoyable listen of the day.</p> <p>The next program on the list was entertaining enough, if you’re among the faithful — Rep. Matt Gaetz’s “Firebrand,” where the Florida congressman gets a jump on his future as a Fox News host by monologuing at length about the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-61-live-overeducated-elites-firebrand-with/id1512848110?i=1000570617971" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;evils of the college-educated elite&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-61-live-overeducated-elites-firebrand-with/id1512848110?i=1000570617971&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">evils of the college-educated elite</a> and the Democrat deep state’s desire to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-65-live-spy-games-firebrand-with-matt-gaetz/id1512848110?i=1000574913780" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;spy, Stasi-style, on its political dissenters&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-65-live-spy-games-firebrand-with-matt-gaetz/id1512848110?i=1000574913780&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">spy, Stasi-style, on its political dissenters</a>.

It’s a textbook case of an older, white, male liberal navigating the rhetorical minefield of a world very different from the one in which he came of age — not without pathos, but not exactly an edifying interview, either, as the authors are teed up for nothing beyond the stock book-tour pitch.</p> <p>After spending a couple of hours with Al, for reasons of scarcity I went back into the archive and re-examined “The Defining Decade,” a forward-looking miniseries produced in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election by now-Secretary of Transportation (and obvious presidential-ambition-harborer) Pete Buttigieg. He is often maligned among young progressive-leaning voters, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/01/01/pete-buttigieg-enrages-left-liberals-2020-091479" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;unfairly in the opinion of some podcast reviewers&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/01/01/pete-buttigieg-enrages-left-liberals-2020-091479&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c0016&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c0017&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">unfairly in the opinion of some podcast reviewers</a>, as an automaton, or some genetic experiment by McKinsey &amp; Company to see how much cringeworthy earnestness it can pack into one person while maximizing shareholder value. He doesn’t do himself any favors in that department as a podcaster.</p> <p>The quotient of “Democrat-speak” — a commonly-used term for the kind of stilted, platitude-ridden, focus-grouped rhetoric that many credit for dragging down the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign — reaches dangerous levels with, well… his series-closing interview with Hillary Clinton, 34 tooth-grinding minutes of mutual compliments and wonk-talk that evaporate from one’s head instantly upon entering the ears. If you are the kind of person for whom deep enthrallment at a conference panel is the norm rather than the exception, run, don’t walk to listen to this conversation.</p> <p>Surely it was educational for Buttigieg to hear Clinton’s pointers on exactly what he should hope or ask for in his secretarial brief, and the former First Lady and Senator has authentic experience to bring to bear. For anyone else, however, it’s deadly. If Buttigieg, who truly can be engaging in his own right, hopes to hone his skill as a retail politician, he would do well to listen back to most of these conversations as an example of exactly how <i>not&nbsp;</i>to capture the attention of the American people.</p> <p>The overall impact of nearly 10 hours of politician-generated audio entertainment was, predictably, exhausting. I wasn’t quite prepared for an entire day of listening to speech that was carefully crafted <i>not&nbsp;</i>to make any news. So why do they do it? </p> <p>It’s too glib to simply say that politicians podcast because modern media incentivizes them to create a “brand.” After all, the vast majority still don’t, and plenty of them thirstily build that brand by other digitally assisted means on Twitter, TikTok or elsewhere. Podcasting politicians most likely choose that format because of what it implies: A learning and bonding experience, where important information is passed along to the listener like a friend or peer invited into the room to share in the discussion. At their core, podcasts exist to fill space and make us feel less alone, like the radio programs of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/21/podcasts/the-daily/delilah-radio-host.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Delilah&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/21/podcasts/the-daily/delilah-radio-host.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c0018&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c0019&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Delilah</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/obituaries/art-bell-radio-host-who-tuned-in-to-the-dark-side-dies-at-72.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Art Bell&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/obituaries/art-bell-radio-host-who-tuned-in-to-the-dark-side-dies-at-72.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c001a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf98c001b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Art Bell</a> before them.</p> <p>Politicians, definitionally, cannot do this — they are precluded from the level of candor and personality necessary to forge that bond by the demands of their office.

Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of State, made an appearance, along with Dick Gephardt, the former House Democratic leader. Les Francis, a former deputy White House chief of staff in the Carter administration, was watching the waiting room for late arrivals while, from his log house in the foothills outside of Denver, Gary Hart, the former senator from Colorado, was having difficulty logging on.</p> <p>For three or four years, the Carter administration veterans had been meeting like this to keep in touch. But more recently, as Republicans went from initial, brief discomfort with the Jan. 6 attack to rallying behind former President Donald Trump’s false assertions that the election was stolen, their conversations had begun to become more urgent, focusing on the state of American democracy. And the assessment was grim.</p> <p>Trump had tried to overturn an election. Now, with the GOP widely expected to control the House and, potentially, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/07/moore-harper-scotus-independent-state-legislature-election-power/670992/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;critical statehouses in 2024&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/07/moore-harper-scotus-independent-state-legislature-election-power/670992/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9930000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9930001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">critical statehouses in 2024</a>, it appeared at least possible that a second attempt by Trump or some like-minded Republican to seize or cling to power undemocratically might just succeed.</p> <p>“It’s time to ring the alarm bells, and it’s time to say to people, ‘Hey, wake up. There’s nothing written that democracy always has to exist,” Gephardt told them. “In fact, most writers on democracy say that the average life of a democracy in history is about 300 years. Well, we’re moving into the 300-year mark. So, this is an alarming situation.”</p> <p>He said, “It’s scary as hell.”<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/ea/ea/3f8aa7d645a3830c0ac4259be008/220818-gephardt-ap-773.jpg"> <br> <p>Yet as members of the Carter group discussed the prospect of democracy’s collapse, there was another crisis that troubled them just as much: The fact that, as a voting issue, so few <i>Democrats&nbsp;</i>seemed to care.</p> <p>Even after the experience of 2020 and the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — and even as Republicans in the midterms parrot Trump’s falsehoods — democracy has polled relatively low on the electorate’s list of concerns. The Jan. 6 committee hearings were encouraging. But Democrats competing in elections this year have not been pressing the issue anywhere near as hard as other concerns.</p> <p>Of the more than $300 million spent by Democrats on broadcast advertisements this year throughout the country, ads that mentioned Jan. 6, the insurrection, democracy or stolen elections accounted for less than 4 percent of all spending, according to an analysis compiled for POLITICO by the ad tracking firm AdImpact. That’s less than Democrats spent on subjects ranging from energy and the environment to education, roads and infrastructure, abortion, health care, Trump and guns.</p> <p>And the problem was even worse than that. In some cases, Democrats were themselves taking anti-democratic positions, spending millions of dollars in Republican primaries to elevate hard-right candidates they viewed as more beatable opponents in the fall. It didn’t seem to matter that some of those candidates were election conspiracy theorists — or that Democrats, if their own candidates faltered in November, could be helping them win.</p> <p>To some members of the Carter group, the discussion surrounding democracy was beginning to feel like the early days of the climate movement, when scientists and some Democrats spoke urgently about a looming crisis, but were <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/11/14/18080758/south-park-time-to-get-cereal-recap-season-22-al-gore-global-warming-manbearpig" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;often mocked or ignored&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/11/14/18080758/south-park-time-to-get-cereal-recap-season-22-al-gore-global-warming-manbearpig&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9930002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9930003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">often mocked or ignored</a>. Starting late last year, I was granted access to some of their Zoom calls and was in contact with some participants more directly, and the question that kept coming up was how to mainstream their concerns about democracy — and do it more quickly than the climate’s still-halting march into the political consciousness.</p> <p>“It’s that tired old metaphor of the frog and the water,” Bo Cutter, a veteran of both the Carter and Clinton administrations, told me recently. “If you raise it with people who are … actively involved in policy and politics, you tend to get sort of a patronizing pat on the head and a, ‘Well, America has always come through in the end’ kind of thing.’”</p> <p>“It’s incredibly hard for people to come together around something like this,” he said. “There’s just so much else on people’s minds.”</p> <p>Earlier this year, when I visited Francis, the organizer of the Carter group calls, at his home in Camino, Calif., in the Sierra Nevada foothills east of Sacramento, he said he’d been heartened by the amount of coverage democracy was getting on Sunday morning talk shows and in national newspaper opinion pages.</p> <p>But it was mostly talk.

If anything, the Democratic Party’s prospects look marginally better today than they did just a few weeks ago. Democrats are still widely expected to lose the House, but perhaps not by the margins they once feared.

He sat back in his home office chair and groaned.</p> <p>Democracy, he said, “is more important to the survival of the country than, frankly, daycare for kids or prescription drug prices.”</p> <p>“This may be generational,” said Francis, who is 79. “But for people of my generation who came of age politically in the 1960s, and we were involved with civil rights, anti-war, student rights, all these things, we just are having a hard time believing that this is happening, it’s happening in our lifetime, and it’s happening on our watch.”</p> <p>The midterms are now less than three months away. Trump may announce his 2024 campaign any day. And Republicans in this year’s primaries have been nominating gubernatorial and secretary of state candidates who, if elected, could influence the outcome of the next presidential election, overseeing the machinery of the election and its certification at the state level.</p> <p>The worst-case scenario, said Hart, a two-time presidential candidate, would be “the 2020 election quadrupled: Every state count challenged in state courts and federal courts, all 50 cases going to the Supreme Court, and who knows how this Court’s going to rule on things like that.” Cutter described that prospect as a “doomsday scenario” with more than trivial odds.</p> <p>None of this is news to Democrats.

And while I believe that is the most important issue of our time — the assault on our democracy — I also believe that it is absolutely not politically salient for most voters. They don’t think about it, and I don’t think they can change that.”</p> <p>The challenge for Democrats, he said, “is that the major catastrophes of our time … are not political winners for us. They’re extraordinarily important and just ignored by most voters.”</p> <p>When I asked Bennett, a veteran of the Michael Dukakis, Bill Clinton and Wesley Clark presidential campaigns, if Democrats should try to change that, he said, “It can’t be done.”</p> <p>“The climate movement has tried to change that for years, and they’ve made, at most, marginal gains in that regard,” Bennett said. “People <i>do</i> care about climate change, sort of, but they don’t vote on it.”</p> <p>Democracy, he said, “is in the bucket with climate change.”</p> <p>It’s that comparison — between democracy and climate — that comes up repeatedly in conversations with Democratic strategists.</p> <p>“It’s exactly the same thing,” said Ken Martin, chair of Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and head of the Association of State Democratic Committees.</p> <p>Voters, he said, are “just thinking about how the hell you put food on the table and how you keep your job.”</p> <p>Even on the Carter group calls, there is a recognition that the issue may not resonate as much as members of the group would like it to.</p> <p>For many voters, said Greg Schneiders, a former Carter aide and Democratic pollster, “if the choice is a benevolent autocrat on your side or a representative of the coastal elites and the ‘deep state’ who might obey all the niceties of a functioning democracy but isn’t on your side, yeah, they’ll take the autocrat.”</p> <p>He said, “If you can’t show that living in a democracy actually ends up with a better result for you personally than living in an autocracy, then you’re asking a lot of people … It’s a tough sell.”</p> <p>As a result, even some true believers in the risk to democracy are approaching it in less abstract ways — not dissimilar from when climate change advocates suggested <a href="https://pangea.stanford.edu/news/perspective-lets-stop-talking-about-climate-change" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;talking to the public less about climate than the immediate public health or economic risks it posed&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://pangea.stanford.edu/news/perspective-lets-stop-talking-about-climate-change&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9940010&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9940011&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">talking to the public less about climate than the immediate public health or economic risks it posed</a>.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/0c/2a/8961e2574f1fab0f81a7f2ef8f7b/220818-climateprotest-getty-773.jpg"> <br> <p>When I asked Skye Perryman, the president of Democracy Forward, about the resonance of democracy in the midterms, she mentioned health care, the minimum wage, education, the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, and economic unrest all as issues of concern to voters.</p> <p>“What we see every day is people deeply concerned about democracy and about the broader promise of democracy — what are their wages going to be, what is their economic opportunity going to be, can they educate their kids, are they going to be able to raise their kids in safe communities? These are broader democracy issues,” she said. “There is a movement that is seeking to eradicate and undermine the very foundation of our democracy … But that same movement is also engaged in a range of conduct that is harmful to people and communities, and that is a democracy issue, too.”<br></p> <br> <p><b>Democratic messaging about</b> democracy itself may pick up once Trump announces he’s running again for president, as is widely expected, especially if Biden seeks a second term.</p> <p>Biden, who was in the Senate even before Carter got to Washington, is steeped in institutional concerns. He cast his 2020 campaign broadly as a return to democratic norms, and in a preview of his likely messaging in 2024, he said of Trump last month: “<a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2022/07/26/its-trump-vs-pence-in-washington-00047869" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;You can’t be pro-insurrection and pro-democracy.

You can’t be pro-insurrection and pro-American.</a>”</p> <p>If the electorate’s attention to threats to democracy can be fleeting, said John Anzalone, the longtime Biden pollster, “the fact is, in some ways we forget democracy worked.”</p> <p>“The fact is that we had a threat,” Anzalone said, referring to the 2020 election. “America rose up, and it kicked its ass.”</p> <p>Still, he said it “wouldn’t surprise anyone” if Biden or Democrats running in some midterm elections make it more of an issue as the campaign season unfolds.</p> <p>There may still be time for that. Most of the party’s paid messaging will not come until after Labor Day. Democrats in some races are issuing fundraising appeals based on their opponents’ statements about elections, and they have found criticizing Republicans for election denialism effective when wrapped into a broader critique of a candidate as “extreme.”</p> <p>On the call in November with the Carter group, Gephardt, who is 81 and living in Florida, said, “Us old people don’t have much of an audience … And we shouldn’t. We’re has-beens. But we love this country, we love this democracy, and we’ve got to play the role of Paul Revere.”</p> <p>But that was in November. This spring, the Carter group met less often, disrupted by a run of deaths and memorial services for members of the group or people close to them. Between March and May, among other people, Albright and two former House representatives — Vic Fazio and Norman Mineta, also a former transportation secretary — passed away. There was a memorial service in May for Walter Mondale, the former vice president who, before his death last year, had been a regular on the calls.</p> <p>By the time the group resumed its regular meetings earlier this summer, the anxiety some members had about democracy in the fall was no less severe. In some ways, they were even more dispirited. (Carter was aware of the group’s meetings, Francis said, but has yet to participate in one. He has publicly warned the country is at risk of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/opinion/jan-6-jimmy-carter.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;losing our precious democracy&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/opinion/jan-6-jimmy-carter.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9950000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9950001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">losing our precious democracy</a>,” while the Carter Center, long involved in monitoring elections abroad, <a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/factsheets/us-democracy-factsheet.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;turned its focus to the United States&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/factsheets/us-democracy-factsheet.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9950002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9950003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">turned its focus to the United States</a> for the first time in 2020.)</p> <p>It’s conventional wisdom among pro-democracy activists globally that one strategy for protecting the ballot is to boost pro-democracy candidates regardless of their party.

In Maryland, the candidate helped by the Democratic Governors Association, Dan Cox — a state lawmaker who organized buses to Washington for the rally preceding the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — is running in such a heavily Democratic state that he is almost certain to lose.

In 2012, then-Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri was all but written off before she intervened in the Republican primary to elevate a weak opponent, Todd Akin, whose campaign imploded after his remarks about “legitimate rape.” One Democratic National Committee member told me, “The practicality of it has been proven in several races.” And given the significance of party affiliation in Washington, he said — when it comes to elections, but also everything else on the Democratic agenda — it may be worth it if it helps a Democrat win.</p> <p>Criticism of the practice may also overstate the risk. There’s a likelihood in some contests that Republicans would have voted for the hard-liner in the primary regardless of anything Democrats did. Highlighting a Republican’s Trump-ian credentials may help him or her in a primary, but it can also serve to define them at a critical moment early in the campaign, blunting any effort they might make to walk back their positions in the general election.</p> <p>“Having them defined early means there is a subset of voters who are never going to consider them” in the general election, said David Turner of the Democratic Governors Association. “It’s educating them about how extreme they are.”</p> <p>Still, there is a queasiness within the Democratic Party about it.

        <![CDATA[<img src="https://static.politico.com/23/2b/9e4b77f747dc9a5a6520f2265641/paper-schaffer-v2.png"> <br> <p>When Stephen Breyer stepped down from the Supreme Court in June, he was obliged to pack up 28 years worth of memos, draft opinions, correspondence, notes and other real-time documentation of his tenure. But he was under no obligation whatsoever when it came to the question of what to do with the papers after that.</p> <p>Officially, the Court’s not saying what will become of Breyer’s material — covering behind-the-scenes activities surrounding every major case from <i>Bush v. Gor</i>e to <i>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</i>. “I have no information to provide at this time regarding Justice Breyer’s papers,” says Patricia McCabe, the Court’s chief information officer.</p> <p>Kenneth Feinberg, the prominent Washington attorney and longtime close friend of Breyer, says that’s because no decision has been made. “The papers are still in his chambers,” Feinberg says, referring to the smaller office space retired justices are allotted. “He is undecided.”</p> <p>The decision on whether to provide answers to the most compelling questions about the court — Who penetrated its inner sanctum? What did the justices really think of each other, and of the momentous changes in the law that they engendered? Which biases and stray thoughts altered their decision-making? — will be Breyer’s alone.</p> <p>If the 84-year-old Breyer had retired from other senior government positions whose work impacts hundreds of millions of citizens, that decision wouldn’t really be up to him. The executive branch is subject to detailed rules laying out what work product must be preserved, when and how it must be released to the general public, and — as Donald Trump has unhappily learned — what happens to officials who don’t play ball.</p> <p>Not so for justices. Breyer, if he so chose, could toss his papers in a bonfire, auction them to the highest bidder, or ship them all to Mar-a-Lago for safekeeping. He could also hold onto them and pick and decide for himself just who gets to take a peek, ensuring that only ideologically friendly types can use the material for books and articles. In his will, he could appoint an executor to continue to enforce whatever standards he sees fit for decades or centuries to come. It’s none of your business.<br></p> <br> <p>“It’s ridiculous,” says Gabe Roth of the advocacy group Fix the Court, which pushes for ethics and transparency reforms for the federal judiciary. “You are a government employee. Your work product should be property of the federal government. You shouldn’t just be able to throw it in the family cabin’s fireplace as justices have been rumored to do in the past.”</p> <p>But that’s exactly what a justice is able to do. Though a federal commission recommended treating judges’ working papers like those of the executive branch as early as 1978, Congress never ordered up any changes. The papers remain the justices’ private property, no matter who paid for the ink.</p> <p>How did this happen? Over the past half-century, as Vietnam and Watergate stripped Americans of many illusions about their leaders, the Supreme Court’s members mostly maintained their image as a noble priesthood — one whose exotic rituals and elite staffing and inscrutable interactions with the public were celebrated, not bemoaned. So as enhanced conflict-of-interest laws, public-meetings rules, mandatory televising of proceedings and the Freedom of Information Act made life more complicated for a variety of other people who draw a federal paycheck, our Olympian judges were largely left alone.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/be/39/3ff2a1844d9b8e48302f52c3307e/gettyimages-1238569901-edit.jpg"> <br> <p>Of course, the justices’ image has become distinctly less Olympian thanks to <i>Bush v. Gore</i>, the hijacking of Antonin Scalia’s seat, the furor over Virginia Thomas’<b>&nbsp;</b>election-denial activities and the public backlash against the overturning of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>.

But as far as work product goes, there’s nothing on the horizon that would impose something like requirements from the National Archives and Records Administration. There’d likely even be some disagreement about just how much specificity Congress could impose on a separate branch of government.</p> <p>The result is a <a href="https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/handle/1805/15007/demaine.pdf?isAllowed=y&amp;sequence=4" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;bizarre status quo&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/handle/1805/15007/demaine.pdf?isAllowed=y&amp;sequence=4&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf99a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf99a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">bizarre status quo</a> where judges set their own rules. Some of them are ludicrously restrictive: Upon his retirement in 2009, David Souter donated his papers to the New Hampshire Historical Society, stipulating that they be sealed until 50 years after his death, which may yet be a while away as the former justice is still alive at 82. Others are merely confusing: William Rehnquist and Antonin Scalia’s papers, held at Stanford and Harvard respectively, open on a rolling basis once all the justices on the court at the time of a particular document have died; Sandra Day O’Connor, on the other hand, will keep her papers closed at the Library of Congress until she and all justices she ever served with have died. (Two sources familiar with Breyer predict his will wind up either at the Library of Congress or at Harvard, under wraps long enough to not trouble his former colleagues.)</p> <p>Still, that beats former Justice Hugo Black, who, upon being hospitalized before his death, had his son destroy a large number of his documents in something they called “Operation Frustrate the Historians.”</p> <p>Mission accomplished. Access to draft opinions, memos and judges’ notes from justices-only conferences could be invaluable in helping document how the court reached various decisions, or showing its ideological drift in general. To be sure, access to archives wouldn’t lead to perfect information: A lot of the justices’ interactions are face-to-face, and even the conference-notes depictions of what is said are apt to be slanted by the note-taker. But if researchers are able to access State Department cables about the Iraq invasion, there’s no reason they shouldn’t be able to see memos and drafts about some momentous Court case of similar vintage.</p> <p>It would be even better to get access to things like calendars and correspondence, or even lunch receipts and legal-junket travel reservations. If a justice was dining with someone with strong opinions on a major judicial matter — as my colleagues Peter S. Canellos and Josh Gerstein reported in a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/08/religious-right-supreme-court-00044739" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1660854019194,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f766-d6b4-a7e5-f7ee71fe0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1660854019194,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f766-d6b4-a7e5-f7ee71fe0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/08/religious-right-supreme-court-00044739&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-b29d-dabd-ad8f-b2bd14290001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;couple of stories&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-b29d-dabd-ad8f-b2bd14290000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">couple of stories</a> this summer <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/20/religious-right-alito-abortion-00047055" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1660854034586,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f766-d6b4-a7e5-f7ee71fe0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1660854034586,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f766-d6b4-a7e5-f7ee71fe0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/20/religious-right-alito-abortion-00047055&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-b29d-ddf6-ada7-be9d53080001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;about antiabortion activists’ interactions with justices&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-b29d-ddf6-ada7-be9d53080000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">about antiabortion activists’ interactions with justices</a> who struck down <i>Roe</i> — it seems like a matter of public interest. Likewise, given the number of Supreme Court clerks who go on to be big shots themselves, it would be really useful to know what kinds of advice they were giving their bosses. (The revelation that William Rehnquist had written a pro-segregation memo as a clerk imperiled his own nomination decades later.)</p> <p>But the scandal of Supreme Court records ought to matter to folks other than history nerds. The current situation also perpetuates one of the most toadyish cultures in Washington. In a city where reporters and principals fashion themselves as adversarial, one of the most striking things about the insular universe of the Supreme Court is the obsequiousness. With just nine principals to watch, reporters and scholars and experts are forever at risk of being frozen out. It’s hard to imagine that this phenomenon is unrelated to some of the odd gaps in court coverage, like the lack of attention to Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s health as she opted to not resign during the Obama administration.</p> <p>By treating justices’ work product as private property, the system allows them to maintain a bit of that same leverage over the history books, too. The justices, after all, can violate their papers’ official stipulations whenever they want, sharing with a friendly scholar or biographer. Imagine how different our histories of Vietnam might be if Henry Kissinger — still alive at 99! — was free to share official federal documents only with favored chroniclers.</p> <p>Stephen Wermiel, a reporter turned law professor who worked on a biography with the cooperation of Justice William Brennan, was one of the select few who were granted access by a justice. During the 1990s, he used to go down to the courthouse, where the retired justice’s secretary would use her key to unlock the downstairs storage room controlled by Brennan where the files were kept. The general public would have to wait to see the material on a rolling schedule; the final pieces weren’t opened up until 2017, 20 years after Brennan’s death.</p> <p>“I think there’s a huge amount to be learned about how the Court works, about how justices think, about how they interact with each other, from having access to their papers,” Wermiel says.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, it’s the justices themselves who have been cagiest about agreeing to new transparency rules. In 1991, when the entirety of Thurgood Marshall’s papers were made public upon his death, just 18 months after he left the court, former colleagues were outraged and tried to lobby the Librarian of Congress to keep them under wraps. The arguments were that deliberations ought to remain secret and imminent publicity could make judges less than candid with one another. Defenders of the status quo also argue that the Court, unlike other branches, lays out its reasoning (at great length) in its opinions. Reasoning that didn’t make the cut, the logic goes, affects no one.</p> <p>In fact, there aren’t any advocates calling for all of the papers to be put online right away — only that some sort of schedule be mandated, and a process that makes material open to everyone, not just a favored few.</p> <p>Ironically, Wemiel says that at a time when the Court’s reputation has taken a pounding, better access to justices’ papers might actually help their battered image.</p> <p>“The message in all the archival work that I’ve done is that the Court is a place that works in a relatively thoughtful, kind of scholarly, way,” he says. “We’re at a point where it is easy to jump to the conclusion that five justices of the Court had their own political, personal and religious objective to do away with abortion. I suspect their papers would not show it that way.” Scholars may dream of unearthing a memo laying out a hackish quid-pro-quo or an email revealing some horrific personal prejudice, but the reality is likely to be more prosaic and more earnest.</p> <p>That’s unlikely to sway a court whose members, especially in this season of anger and protest, seem especially keen on keeping their temple unsullied by the hurly-burly of public attention.</p> <p>“There’s nothing governing emails, nothing governing computer-generated material, nothing governing anything,” Wermiel says. “I think the only thing that would get the Court to take it on themselves is if there was a really significant and credible threat that Congress was going to impose it.”<br></p> <br>]]>

Most Democrats have welcomed it as gratification long delayed, Trump loyalists have condemned it as a “Deep State” abuse of power, and more measured Republicans have split the difference. Observers have also pointed to the danger of riling up Trump’s base and stoking his determination to retake the presidency.</p> <p>But perhaps the raid’s most sobering result is the increased yet unavoidable risk it ultimately poses of widespread civil breakdown. Watching agents search Mar-a-Lago could turn a large enough portion of Trump’s far-right base decisively against federal authority that its defiance could shift from episodic to systemic, eventually leading to regular armed resistance to federal law enforcement on the order of Ruby Ridge and potentially even Waco.</p> <p>To avoid this outcome, law enforcement must strike a fine balance.<b> </b>During the 1990s, one of us was director and then senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council, coordinating the fleeting federal response to what appeared to be rising right-wing militancy behind the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995. The other lived in Northern Ireland, chronicling the shaky end of the Troubles and the fitful effort to neutralize illegal armed groups, including the Provisional Irish Republican Army and the loyalist paramilitaries. In both cases, law enforcement agencies were required to walk the line between proactive enforcement and calibrated forbearance to ensure that political violence would be neither tolerated, on the one hand, nor incited, on the other.</p> <p>It wasn’t easy to do. And political conditions in each place were even <i>less</i> conducive to political violence than they are in the contemporary United States.</p> <h3 style="text-align: center">Yesterday’s Steady-State versus Today’s Tinderbox</h3> <p>Federal agents have moved aggressively against far-right groups in the past, with troubling results. In 1992, the standoff between federal agents and a white supremacist suspect and his family at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, resulted the deaths of a U.S. marshal, the wife of the suspect and his son. The following year, during federal officers’ long besiegement of the compound of the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas, 86 members of the group died. Those events were containable, though, mainly through still more vigorous law-enforcement. They did not impel the large-scale organization of operational extremist groups or produce a concerted series of attacks on U.S. government targets.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/1c/1d/35720d6541b8899931d785dd6d79/ruby-ridge-standoff-aphs411116.jpg"> <br> <p>Timothy McVeigh did confirm that the two incidents were key catalysts of his devastating 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people. The ensuing investigation had a chilling effect that, by the end of the decade, appeared to have quelled any burgeoning threat of far-right domestic terrorism or insurgency. By 9/11, the specter of transnational jihadist terrorism had overtaken such worries. There was abundant flirtation with extremism and an undercurrent of more toxic and deeply felt far-right dissatisfaction, as there had been<b> </b>since the Civil War in the form of the Lost Cause Myth and persistent bigotry, but it had limited popular purchase and remained largely underground.</p> <p>The differences between the 1990s and the present day in terms of the likelihood of political violence and civil breakdown in the United States are stark.</p> <p>For one, there’s the newfound legitimacy of domestic political violence. In the 1990s, the militia movement was merely percolating, committed to resisting government but not interested in taking the offensive or prepared to do so. Mainstream American liberals and conservatives both firmly considered domestic political violence unacceptable. Only conspicuous law-enforcement debacles could inspire even an extremist like McVeigh to lethal terrorist action against fellow Americans. Today, though, Blue and Red are arguably irreconcilable, and Trump has hauled the far right to the surface and enlisted it in his personal service. Some of his supporters are so convinced that his presidency was stolen from him that they apprehend the subdued, circumspect, non-violent execution of a search warrant on his residence as a <i>casus belli</i>, and authoritative and admired figures encourage them to do so.</p> <p>Steve Bannon labeled the FBI a “gestapo.” Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene called for Congress to defund the FBI. Far-right pundits have proclaimed “This. Means. War.” and characterized the search as a “declaration of war.” Posts on far-right internet forums have been more violent than any since January 6. Last weekend, armed Trump supporters clad in body armor held a protest outside the FBI’s Phoenix office. Threats against federal law enforcement have spiked, intensifying a growing trend. Some extremists have “doxxed” FBI agents, publicizing their personal information to enable others to harass them or target them with violence. Such behavior seems intended to mobilize those of McVeigh’s ilk.<br></p> <br> <p>Perverse though it is, the perceived legitimacy of far-right vigilantism is the main upshot of the January 6 insurrection, Trump’s ongoing rhetoric about the Deep State, and the valorization of armed self-help in the form of the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse and the proliferation of stand-your-ground and permissive gun-carry laws on the state level. The militias and other avid Trump loyalists now see themselves as pro-state in the sense that they support the real-America-in-waiting and its anointed leader.</p> <p>Another important difference is the growth of social media as engines of political violence. Militia organizations were essentially atomized in the 1990s, without the benefit of mass communication or cooperation. Now, they are thoroughly networked through Facebook and other digital platforms, over which they feed one another’s fervor as well as organize events and coordinate paramilitary operations, as demonstrated by the digitally driven coalescence of the Jan. 6 insurgents. Ironically, the militias have also learned from jihadists' increasingly effective use of the internet for recruitment and operational coordination, and are themselves becoming transnationally networked.</p> <p>Finally, owing to persistent far-right Republican opposition to effective gun control in spite of rising gun violence, military-grade weapons — notoriously, AR-15 assault rifles — have become far more widely available over the last 30 years, and militia members have accumulated them. More permissive gun ownership and carry legislation has made it easier for them to mobilize in force.</p> <h3 style="text-align: center">Law Enforcement’s Burden</h3> <p>The potentially incendiary effect of the Mar-a-Lago search will not have been lost on the Department of Justice or the FBI. Federal law enforcement agencies have for some time been reluctant to move forcefully on far-right militias for fear of escalation, while elected local prosecutors are loath to indict those who help put them in office. Given its own apparent awareness of these constraints, it is a fair inference that the Justice Department concluded that searching Mar-a-Lago, even if it will incite the same far-right forces, was mandatory from the standpoint of upholding the rule of law.<b> </b>Indeed, what is known of the content of the documents sought and reasonably believed to be in Trump’s possession — including classified information related to nuclear weapons and the identities of intelligence assets — underscores the point.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/29/17/acbb3f414d87bcc49e7a202c6ee5/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1242440906"> <br> <p>There is little doubt that Attorney General Merrick Garland fully understood that the raid would make it more dangerous for federal agents to serve warrants on far-right extremists. At the same time, the threat of domestic political violence that Trump willfully elevated does call for more proactive enforcement efforts by federal authorities, especially the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Yet because the Mar-a-Lago raid has made such operations riskier, federal agencies may be inclined to confront suspects with SWAT-style force protection. This would be less a departure from than a continuation of recent practices: heightened perceptions of the jihadist terrorist threat since 9/11 have induced police departments to purchase military equipment and take a more muscular approach to relatively routine operations. The militarization of the domestic counterterrorism effort could further antagonize far-right groups and make civil war a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p> <p>A spiraling confrontation between the state and its adversaries also poses the risk of fracturing federal law enforcement itself. While it’s well known that local law enforcement, whether municipal police departments or exurban sheriffs’ offices, often identify with radicalized far-right movements that oppose federal authority, some members of federal law enforcement are also prone to empathize with the other side. Anecdotal evidence points to tensions within the FBI itself over the Mar-a-Lago raid.<br></p> <br> <p>Mature democracies have gone too far in the past. In 1969, the British government sent troops to Northern Ireland to quell growing community unrest over Catholic nationalist political and civil rights protests. The soldiers were initially welcomed as peacekeepers. But as grievances could not be immediately addressed and protests escalated, the British government resorted to more extreme measures, including direct armed confrontation, mass internment of those suspected of paramilitary activities, the statutory establishment of “scheduled offenses” for political violence, and the creation of dedicated, non-jury courts for trying those charged with them. The IRA exploited this too, orchestrating marches and demonstrations that would prompt the Royal Ulster Constabulary to break out the riot gear, which served to confirm their narrative of state oppression, generate sympathetic headlines and news spots, and win recruits to the armed struggle. Eventually, the public came to see IRA militants as soldiers in a civil war. By the mid-1970s, London understood that demilitarization and normalization would make the conflict more tractable, but by then the gouge was set: the Troubles would last 25 years, extend violence to the British mainland, and palsy Northern Irish society.</p> <p>In dealing with Euskadi ta Askatasuna (ETA), the Basque separatist group, Spain used aggressive tactics similar to those Britain brought to bear in Northern Ireland; that conflict too lasted a generation. Italy and West Germany were more cautious and discreet in handling the Red Brigades and the Baader-Meinhof Gang, respectively. Despite spectacular and shocking campaigns of assassination, kidnapping and terrorism, the two groups gained less traction than the IRA and ETA did and were at least marginally more manageable. France has resolutely treated Algerian and Corsican nationalist militant groups as ordinary criminals, and their trajectory has been notably flat.</p> <p>Given these precedents, only a resolute law-enforcement approach to counterterrorism, mounting the effort one search warrant and indictment at a time and resisting escalation, has a prayer of staving off wholesale civil conflict in this country. The FBI was right to serve the warrant. It was also right to do so in an unassuming manner, after exhausting all other means of enforcing the law. Now, it is incumbent on federal agencies to enforce the law without galvanizing a far-right movement primed for violence against the state. We might be at a tipping point between fragile order and general disorder, but tipping points by their very nature cannot be known in advance. Federal authorities face that uncertainty every day, every hour. They are compelled to be, vexingly and heroically, both strategically aggressive and tactically restrained.</p>]]>

Calling out those he labeled as “extreme” Republicans, Biden said: “It’s not just Trump, it’s the entire philosophy that underpins the — I’m going to say something, it’s like semi-fascism.”</p> <p>Later, at a national Democratic Party event before a few thousand people packed into a nearby high school gym, Biden added: “I respect conservative Republicans. I don’t respect these MAGA Republicans.”</p> <p>“There are not many real Republicans anymore,” Biden added.</p> <p>No president in recent memory has had a better month of August, lifting the mood inside the White House and injecting fresh hope across the party ahead of what long looked like a bleak midterm election. In recent weeks, Democrats have passed a slew of marquee bills filled with deliverables that Biden ticked through in his speeches. The president painted the last year-plus as something of an American comeback — and a recovery from the depths of the pandemic and economic turmoil: “We’ve come a long way,” he said.</p> <p>And after a recent stretch of self-isolation as he recovered from Covid, Biden appeared to relish the opportunity to close out the night by wading into the audience and spending several minutes grinning for selfies.</p> <p>Republicans called the president’s comment about fascism “despicable,” with a spokesperson for the GOP saying Americans are still “suffering” from high inflation.</p> <p>For Biden, spending the evening in a blue state with few competitive elections pointed to the careful calculation the White House faces in deploying him over the next 75 days. While the president’s approval numbers have ticked up of late, he still hovers around the low- to mid-40s, and many Democrats remain reluctant to appear with him.</p> <p>Onstage in Rockville, Biden highlighted his administration’s recent cancellation of student loan debt, as well as Democrats’ ongoing fight for abortion rights. He listed other campaign promises yet unfulfilled, including universal pre-K. At one point, he presided over a slideshow presentation that highlighted the plan of Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), the head of the Republican Party’s Senate campaign arm, to sunset federal programs every five years. Biden said that includes Medicare and Social Security.</p> <p>“The MAGA Republicans don’t just threaten our personal rights and economic security,” the president said. “They’re a threat to our very democracy. They refuse to accept the will of the people. They embrace political violence. They don’t believe in democracy.”</p> <p>Wading into the impact of his climate and health care legislation, Biden said that “the survival of our planet is on the ballot.” If Republicans win control of Congress, he noted, “it won’t matter where you live: Women won’t have the right to choose anywhere. Anywhere.”</p> <p>Earlier, he criticized the impact the Trump administration had on the United States’ stature in global politics, referring to Russian President Vladmir Putin’s recent aggression in Ukraine.</p> <p>“I underestimated how much damage the previous four years had done in terms of America’s reputation in the world,” Biden said.</p> <p>Biden’s rally brought in more than 3,600 people in a gym and two overflow rooms. The Democratic National Committee has reported record midterm fundraising for this point in the year, at $255 million for this cycle and $92 million for the year.</p>]]>

And as the debate over what to do lingered, aides began to take steps to try and manage internal deliberations.</p> <p>Student loans were regularly in the top five issues in the correspondence that the White House received from Americans each week, according to a person familiar with an internal report. And White House officials at some point last year told the team handling that correspondence to simply stop selecting so many letters for Biden to review because he hadn’t made up his mind on the issue, according to a person briefed on the interaction.</p> <p>As the president kept putting off a decision on canceling student loans, however, the prospect of restarting loans for millions of Americans continued to come to a head. His administration had been routinely extending a moratorium on student loan payments put in place at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. But at one point last fall, officials began to prepare seriously for resuming payments for tens of millions of Americans and they were prepared to do so without any decision on canceling debt, people familiar with the discussions said.

The plan will deliver hundreds of billions of dollars of relief to tens of millions of borrowers and transform the federal government’s student loan program. It will also extend the moratorium a final time, until Dec. 31, 2022, after which Biden vowed he would require borrowers to resume paying their loans.<br></p> <br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6311358220112" frameborder="0"></iframe> <br> <p>The process by which the president came to this policy was contentious and often confusing, filled with high stakes negotiations, pleas from outside stakeholders, internal disagreements, and last-ditch lobbying efforts from key Democratic lawmakers. And in many ways, it grew to echo the governing style that has defined Biden’s tenure in elected office: deliberativeness that can frustrate those around him, a policy platform that seeks consensus, but a late-lean toward progressivism that ends up surprising his liberal critics.</p> <p>Biden entered the presidency deeply skeptical of the idea of writing off large chunks of student loan debt. He questioned publicly whether he had the authority to do it, and he ruled out emphatically the $50,000 amount of loan forgiveness many progressives aggressively were pushing. From Day One, a coalition of activists, advocacy groups, labor unions and racial justice organizations waged a pressure campaign to move him on the matter.</p> <p>“You're not going to get everything that you're looking for, but you must push for as much as possible,” said Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP and among the most vocal proponents of debt cancellation in regular communication with the White House.</p> <p>Johnson was among those proponents of debt cancellation who agonized over the administration’s indecision on the issue. The White House extended the pause on student loan payments and interest — which began under the Trump administration — on four occasions, each time without an answer on the bigger question of broad-based relief.</p> <p>But while outside advocates fretted, advisers who were internally pushing for broader cancellation believed time was on their side. They viewed the repeated extensions of the payment pause as helpful for keeping the issue alive and active on the president’s docket. Several people familiar with the discussions also said that drawing out the decision toward closer to the election helped amplify the political pressure on the White House to grant more generous relief to borrowers.</p> <p>“We needed time to make a deliberate decision versus a gut reaction,” said one administration official who worked on the issue.</p> <p>Still, there were hurdles.<b> </b>The conversations within the administration seemed to circle endlessly around many of the same complex legal, political and economic issues surrounding loan forgiveness, several people familiar with the deliberations said.</p> <p>One person familiar with the administration’s thinking said that Biden was committed to making good on his campaign promise to cancel $10,000 of debt but that he drew a red line on the need to target the relief to borrowers who needed it the most — and away from higher-earning borrowers who did not.</p> <p>White House discussions for months were centered around how Biden could cancel $10,000 of debt for various populations of borrowers. White House advisers considered a wide range of permutations for income limitations and targeted relief for individual groups of borrowers, such as public service workers, according to people familiar with the discussions. Other discussions focused on whether to target relief only to borrowers with undergraduate debt, rather than include graduate borrowers, those people said. Officials also examined whether to treat debt accrued by borrowers at public universities differently than loans taken out to attend private schools.</p> <p>Administration officials also considered ways to provide as much benefit to lower-wealth borrowers as possible, and viewed Pell grant benefits, which are already means-tested to low- and middle-income borrowers, as a good proxy.

Groups complained that the administration wasn’t being responsive to their outreach. But a major strategy among advocates “was to never close doors and to show the administration that when they do good things that help people with student debt they’ll get cheered for it,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center. He pointed to the growing momentum from the Biden administration for canceling billions of dollars of loans by expanding existing programs for borrowers who work in public service, students defrauded by their college and individuals who become severely disabled.</p> <p>The tide began to turn toward significant debt relief at the beginning of the year, several people familiar with the discussion said. By that time, Biden administration attorneys within the White House and Justice Department had largely resolved the issue of whether they believed canceling $10,000 of debt for borrowers was, generally speaking, an option legally available to the president, according to a person familiar with the administration’s thinking. </p> <p>The policy debate was also moving forward.

Members of the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus lobbied Biden to cancel debt until finally, this past week, Biden began to make up his mind. As parts of the administration’s plan began to leak, Johnson fired off one of his last public warning shots. Simply canceling $10,000 of debt for some borrowers was woefully insufficient, he warned. “If the rumors are true, we’ve got a problem,” he said in a statement.</p> <p>Privately, Johnson spoke with senior White House officials on Wednesday morning before the formal announcement, as well as the two days prior amid a frenzied, last-minute push to finalize the plan.</p> <p>Ultimately, Biden announced that he was canceling $20,000 of debt for 27 million student loan borrowers who also received Pell grants, which won the NAACP’s praise. Most of the other 43 million federal student loan borrowers will qualify for $10,000 of relief.</p> <p>The president gave an address announcing the details back at the White House. It was Rice who got to take the turn addressing it directly with reporters.</p> <p>Biden was “clear from the campaign that he was prepared to relieve up to $10,000 in broad-based cancellation,” she told them. “He listened and consulted and studied.”</p> <p><i>Alex Thompson and Anna Gronewold contributed to this report.</i></p>]]>

The Obama-era program currently offers work permits and protection from deportation to more than 600,000 undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>“Today, we are fulfilling our commitment to preserve and strengthen DACA by finalizing a rule that will reinforce protections, like work authorization, that allow Dreamers to live more freely and to invest in their communities more fully,” President Joe Biden said in a statement, referring to young people who were brought into the U.S. and have remained without legal status.</p> <p>Biden went on to directly call on Republicans on Capitol Hill to move for a legislative solution.</p> <p>“I will do everything within my power to protect Dreamers, but Congressional Republicans should stop blocking a bill that provides a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers,” Biden said. “It is not only the right thing to do, it is also the smart thing to do for our economy and our communities.”</p> <p>Congress has long been unable to reach any kind of immigration deal that would garner enough bipartisan support to pass the Senate.

He noted that it provides “some stability to DACA recipients and make[s] it more difficult for a future administration to rescind DACA, which is a lawful exercise of prosecutorial discretion.”</p> <p>“However, this rule cannot provide permanent legal status or fully protect DACA recipients from relentless Republican legal challenges to the program,” Durbin said. “Only Congress can protect them.”</p> <p>But some immigrant advocates expressed frustration that the Biden administration did not go further in its final rule, opting to keep the same criteria from when the program was created in 2012.</p> <p>“This final DACA rule fails to strengthen the program by not expanding it to include the majority of undocumented immigrant youth who are graduating from high school this year and not eligible for the program because of arbitrary cut-off dates,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, deputy director of federal advocacy for United We Dream.</p> <p>“While Congress must pass permanent protections for all, President Biden cannot hide behind the courts or Congress.

The obscure unit is nonetheless poised to wield outsized influence over the administration’s policy ambitions, especially if Democrats lose control of either congressional chamber this fall.</p> <p>The office serves as a gatekeeper for rulemaking government-wide, coordinating, vetting and approving hundreds of federal regulations each year. It has final say over which agency priorities get fast-tracked and which get put on ice, and it will play a direct role in implementing major elements of Democrats' just-passed climate, health and tax law.</p> <p>“The future of the Biden agenda rests on how efficiently large groups of people can edit Word documents,” said one administration official. “When everyone’s aligned, they can move fast. But sometimes, it’s death by a thousand cuts.”</p> <p>Absent full control of Congress, the administration’s only sure path to advancing its goals across a range of top policy issues will be through regulatory action — giving OIRA broad power to shape the final two years of Biden’s term.</p> <p>That lengthy to-do list includes quarterbacking agency efforts to roll out more stringent environmental regulations, deliver on Biden's vow to lower health care costs and alter parts of the tax code.</p> <p>It will need to clear rules bolstering infrastructure programs and review new immigration initiatives underway at the Homeland Security Department — all while coordinating around the dozens more mundane rules required to keep the government running.<br></p> <br> <p>“OIRA is always at the center of administrative activity — the joke is it’s the most powerful agency nobody’s ever heard of,” said Sharon Block, who served as its acting chief through Biden’s first year. “Now, it becomes even more important.”</p> <p>Since the office’s creation roughly 40 years ago, no recent administration has waited this long to nominate a permanent OIRA administrator. Block, who said she had no interest in the permanent job, left in February and the position has since been filled by another interim leader, Dominic Mancini, a 20-year veteran of the office.</p> <p>White House officials have waffled for months over selecting a nominee, four people familiar with the process said, distracted by the various crises facing the administration and confounded by an ideological battle over OIRA that’s served as a microcosm of the fissures within the Democratic Party.</p> <p>Progressive lawmakers and activists, still fuming over an Obama-era approach to rulemaking they contend was overly conservative and deferential to corporations, have pressed the Biden administration to break with tradition and pick a leader eager to hasten a wide array of regulations into law.</p> <p>But economists and budget experts in the party’s establishment have pushed back, cautioning that Biden’s regulatory czar should serve more as a moderating force who prioritizes efficiency over speed — carefully weighing the merits of major regulations to determine how best to spend the administration’s limited time and resources.</p> <p>“There’s a fork in the path,” said Michael Livermore, a University of Virginia law professor who has written extensively about OIRA. “Either return to the Obama/Bush/Clinton mode of moderates or … put someone in place who’s a hardcore ideologue aligned with the more wing-y elements of the party.”</p> <p>Biden officials early in the administration signaled support for liberals in the behind-the-scenes battle over OIRA.

The person added that in the meantime it has highly qualified people leading OIRA. A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget, which houses the 50-person OIRA, similarly said it plans to share an update "soon" on any changes to its regulatory review process. <br></p> <br> <p>Whoever Biden picks is unlikely to be installed until the end of the year at the earliest, with the prospect that the confirmation process could drag into 2023. And if the Senate flips, some worry, Biden risks missing his window to shape an office tasked with managing the under-the-radar work critical to cementing his policy legacy.</p> <p>For Biden, executing on his regulatory priorities comes with the added challenge of fending off an increasingly conservative judiciary. The Supreme Court earlier this year sharply limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate greenhouse gasses — a decision Democrats sought to blunt in their climate bill by specifically granting the agency the authority to tackle emissions. </p> <p>Still, the verdict has cast doubt on the administration’s ability to make ambitious administrative reforms across the board without running into immediate legal challenges, driving a further wedge between Democrats’ liberal and centrist wings. Progressives maintain the administration should go for broke and push out a wave of far-reaching regulations — challenging Republicans to sue on several fronts.</p> <p>But that’s an approach the White House has yet to embrace, wary of getting bogged down in court battles that risk further restricting the power Biden can wield through the executive branch.</p> <p>“Frankly, I think progressives are going to be disappointed,” Livermore said of the administration’s approach to its administrative agenda. “I don’t think he has any interest in losing in the Supreme Court on a major regulatory action.”</p>]]>

Wade </i>in June<i> </i>and will leave much of the South and Plains states with virtually no access to the procedure. The laws could also make it harder for people to access non-abortion care, including for a miscarriage and family planning.</p> <p>In Texas, which has banned all abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy for nearly a year, abortion providers now <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/06/potential-abortion-bans-and-penalties-by-state-00030572" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;risk a life sentence&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/06/potential-abortion-bans-and-penalties-by-state-00030572&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9ad0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9ad0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">risk a life sentence</a> for performing an abortion at any time during pregnancy, unless the pregnant person’s life is in danger.</p> <p>Traveling outside of Texas for an abortion “was hard enough as it is, but now we have large blocks of the country that are abortion deserts with no provider at all,” said Abigail Aiken, an associate professor and researcher focusing on abortion at the University of Texas at Austin. “All these trigger bans going into effect at once are changing the picture.”</p> <p>While many people do not know they are pregnant six weeks after conception, Aiken cited her own research and data from the Texas Health Department to argue that a total ban — even with exemptions — is an order of magnitude more restrictive than a law barring abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected. In the first month after Texas’ law took effect, for example, abortions in the state <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/25/abortion-pill-use-spikes-in-texas-as-thousands-of-patients-circumvent-states-ban-00011728" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;declined by about half&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/25/abortion-pill-use-spikes-in-texas-as-thousands-of-patients-circumvent-states-ban-00011728&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9ae0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9ae0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">declined by about half</a> compared to the previous year.</p> <p>“What we saw in Texas was online requests for abortion pills tripled and more people traveled out of state,” Aiken said. “But there were still abortions being provided below that six-week gestational limit. We saw that people became more aware that they had to recognize and address a pregnancy quickly because of the new time pressure.”<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/6d/e0/6e076f9848dbafe464ca87d09ac3/supreme-court-abortion-access-94257.jpg"> <br> <p>The same thing could happen in Tennessee, where abortion is now prohibited except if necessary to save the pregnant person’s life — taking the state’s law prohibiting abortions after the detection of fetal cardiac activity one step further.</p> <p>Gov. Bill Lee, earlier this week, <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/22/tennessee-abortion-law-take-effect-aug-25-gov-bill-lee-doctors-protected/7867269001/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;suggested to local media&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/22/tennessee-abortion-law-take-effect-aug-25-gov-bill-lee-doctors-protected/7867269001/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9ae0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9ae0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">suggested to local media</a> that the new law provides adequate protection for physicians who perform an emergency abortion, even though the statute does not specify exactly what would fall under the exemption for protecting the life of the mother.</p> <p>Some Republican lawmakers have suggested they’d like to fine-tune the bill, though Lee told reporters he thinks the law already “provides for treatment of dangerous maternal health issues.”</p> <p>In Idaho, the state is banning all abortions with exemptions for rape, incest and threats to the life of the mother — and is currently fighting the Biden administration in federal court over whether patients who are at risk for serious but not life-threatening impairments have the right to the procedure.</p> <p>And in North Dakota, the state’s only abortion clinic has already moved across the border to Minnesota, though it is still in court challenging the state’s abortion law — which takes effect Friday.</p> <p>Abortion access will likely diminish further in the coming months in other GOP-controlled states. In Indiana, a new law that will prohibit abortion except in cases of rape, incest, fatal fetal anomaly and life endangerment is scheduled to take effect on Sept. 15.</p> <p>South Carolina lawmakers, who are set to meet next week, are debating a bill that would ban abortion starting at conception with no exceptions for rape and incest. The state ban on abortions taking place after cardiac activity is detected has been blocked by the state Supreme Court. And in West Virginia, legislators are at an impasse on a bill to clarify the state’s pre-<i>Roe</i> abortion law.</p> <p>Even if those bills pass, red state lawmakers say they may put forward other abortion-related proposals in the future — especially to counteract measures to strengthen abortion access in blue states.</p> <p>“This won’t be the end of it,” said West Virginia Senate Majority Leader Tom Takubo. “One adverse thing happens in California, it’ll be a heated discussion here in West Virginia.”</p> <p>And courts are temporarily blocking enforcement of sweeping restrictions in five other states — Arizona, Iowa, Michigan, Utah and Wyoming — as litigation against them proceeds.</p> <p>Court battles currently playing out in both Idaho and Texas that could reach the Supreme Court will also determine what rights both pregnant patients and abortion providers have in emergency situations.</p> <p>“Who is going to decide what care patients receive when they experience a dire medical emergency while pregnant?” said Jeff Dubner, an attorney with Democracy Forward, representing medical groups in both cases. “Is it going to be the physician in the room with them, making calls based on their decades of study, or is it going to be legislators with no medical expertise?”</p> <p><i>Explore the map below for more information about the status of abortion in each state as of Thursday evening.</i><br></p> <br>]]>

Meadows traveled to Georgia for an unannounced visit during recount efforts there, and he joined Trump on a phone call with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger where Trump pressed the state officials to help reverse the outcome.</p> <p>“[T]he Special Purpose Grand Jury’s investigation has revealed that the Witness was involved in setting up the call,” the DA indicated in the filing.</p> <p>The DA’s decision to seek Meadows’ testimony shows the investigation has reached Trump’s door. Already the grand jury has sought testimony from the attorneys and congressional allies who supported and helped devise Trump’s strategy to subvert the election. It’s one of several expansive criminal probes that have become an acute threat to Trump, including the unfolding investigation of highly classified information housed at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and the federal grand jury probe of Trump allies’ efforts to disrupt the transfer of power.</p> <p>Several of those allies, including attorney Kenneth Chesebro and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), are fighting subpoenas to testify to the grand jury. An attorney for Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp argued Thursday in Fulton County Superior Court to quash a subpoena for his testimony.</p> <p>Trump ally Rudy Giuliani appeared last week for a closed-door interview. It’s unclear whether he asserted any privileges. He was recently informed that he has become a target of Willis’ investigation. Sixteen Republican Party leaders and activists who signed certificates falsely claiming to be presidential electors from Georgia are also targets of the probe.</p> <p>Others who have been subpoenaed to appear include Trump attorneys John Eastman and Cleta Mitchell, as well as Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.).</p> <p>Powell helped lead a team of outside lawyers to mount challenges to the election results in various states, and she helped drive false claims about foreign interference and vote-flipping. Waldron was an ally in that effort. Both have been figures of interest to the Jan. 6 select committee investigating the attack on the Capitol.</p> <p>“[Powell] possesses unique knowledge concerning relevant communications between [herself], former President Donald Trump, the Trump Campaign, and other known and unknown individuals involved in the multi-state, coordinated efforts to influence the results of the November 2020 elections in Georgia and elsewhere,” Willis wrote in the filing seeking Powell’s testimony.</p>]]>

She wants answers to her queries by Friday, but did not set a hearing or further proceedings on the former president’s request.</p> <p>Among the issues the judge asked Trump’s attorneys to clarify were such basic points as “the precise relief sought,” why the court has jurisdiction over the dispute, what legal standards apply and whether the former president is seeking an immediate injunction against the government while the legal dispute plays out.</p> <p>The series of questions were Cannon’s first substantive step since Trump filed the action, underscoring the challenge Trump has faced in articulating a legal strategy to combat the criminal inquiry into his handling of presidential records housed at his Florida home since leaving office. Though Trump’s lawyers were notified in April that the FBI was seeking to review materials that had been kept at Mar-a-Lago and had significant concerns about classified information being held there, Trump opted against taking any legal steps until Monday, two weeks after the FBI executed a search warrant at his estate.</p> <p>Trump did not explicitly seek any sort of emergency intervention by the court to halt the Justice Department’s ongoing review of the material — currently being conducted by a “filter team” intended to screen out potentially privileged information — a notable absence in a filing he publicly described as an urgent step. The former president’s motion did ask to “enjoin further review of seized materials by The Government until a Special Master is appointed,” but was not clear on whether Trump was seeking that step right away or only after a judge concluded a special master should be named.</p> <p>Cannon also said she wanted to understand Trump’s view on the effect of ongoing proceedings before Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, who is preparing to consider releasing a redacted version of the affidavit justifying the FBI search but whom Trump has publicly criticized.</p> <p>An attorney for Trump and spokespeople for the former president did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Cannon’s order.<br></p>]]>

That team, known as The Ark, tracked Stone for long stretches of time over two years — including on Jan. 6, 2021, as a mob swarmed the Capitol in an effort to keep Trump in power.</p> <p>The research trip to Denmark is the latest indication of a still ongoing and active investigation by the Jan. 6 committee, even as it nears the release of its final report and legislative recommendations this fall. The panel has signaled it intends to maintain its aggressive pace through the end of the current Congress: Jan. 3 of next year.</p> <p>The substance of the footage the committee aides viewed, and whether it included any raw footage or material that isn’t expected to appear in Guldbrandsen’s forthcoming film, was not immediately clear. </p> <p>"While the committee investigators may find the documentary film footage entertaining they will find no evidence of wrongdoing," Stone said in a statement to POLITICO.</p> <p>"I did exercise my First Amendment right at a legally permitted rally on January 5 to question the many anomalies and irregularities in the 2020 election," he added.</p> <p>Guldbrandsen, a spokesman and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the Jan. 6 select committee declined to comment on the Copenhagen visit.</p> <p>Court filings connected to the criminal cases arising from Jan. 6 have shown that several members of Stone’s personal security detail on the day of the riot by the former president's supporters were members of the far-right Oath Keepers, including some whom the Justice Department later charged with seditious conspiracy. But Stone has maintained he had no awareness of any plans to attack the Capitol.<br></p> <br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6309739774112" frameborder="0"></iframe> <br> <p>Stone invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination before the select committee last year. </p> <p>“Their assertion is that simply because I know members of the Proud Boys and came in contact with members of the Oath Keepers, means I must have had some advance knowledge of the illegal activities of some of their members on January 6th,” Stone said in a July fundraising pitch to supporters. “This is false and there is no conversation, phone call, text message, encrypted message, witness, or documentary film footage that would prove otherwise.”</p> <p>The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/03/04/a-storm-foretold-roger-stone-documentary/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<u>first reported</u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/03/04/a-storm-foretold-roger-stone-documentary/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9b20002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9b20003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>first reported</u></a> on the details and substance of Guldbrandsen’s footage for his upcoming film called “A Storm Foretold,” as well as subsequent requests by the select committee and Justice Department to obtain it.

However, the panel has obtained hours of raw footage from at least two other documentary filmmakers — British documentarians Nick Quested and Alex Holder — after issuing subpoenas. Quested testified live at the select committee’s first major hearing in June.</p> <p>Stone is one of Trump’s longest-running political allies, an often-shadowy adviser whom a jury in 2019 convicted of obstructing congressional investigations into links between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. Trump pardoned Stone for that conviction two weeks before Jan. 6.</p> <p>Guldbrandsen’s footage from Jan. 6 includes video of Stone in his hotel room watching parts of the attack unfold. Among those seen in the room: Joshua James, an Oath Keeper who has pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy for his involvement in the group’s alleged plans.

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) caught on a hot mic discussing with Stone — who was about to face trial on the obstruction charges — the likelihood that Trump would pardon Stone.</p> <p>The Danish documentarian's crew also captured images of Stone using his cellphone, which showed contacts via an encrypted app with Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes. Stone’s contacts within both far-right groups have come under scrutiny from the select committee and DOJ.</p> <p>Notably, in the recent court-authorized search of Mar-a-Lago by federal investigators, the FBI indicated that <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.617854/gov.uscourts.flsd.617854.17.0_29.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<u>it had recovered</u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.617854/gov.uscourts.flsd.617854.17.0_29.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9b20008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9b20009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>it had recovered</u></a> a document it dubbed “Executive Grant of Clemency re: Roger Jason Stone, Jr.”</p>]]>

Now comes the post-Labor Day GOP surge.</p> <p>The Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC aligned with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, is set to narrow the financial disparities currently holding his party back in its bid to retake the Senate. The super PAC has more than $160 million in advertising on the books for the post-Labor Day crunch, according to AdImpact — just the beginning of a cash blitz that's<b> </b>poised to blunt the financial edge that Democratic candidates have enjoyed for 18 months. </p> <p>It’s a repeat in the making of 2020, when the GOP PAC notched <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/23/gop-super-pac-senate-fundraising-431638" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1661460836353,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1661460836353,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/23/gop-super-pac-senate-fundraising-431638&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d6c8-dcde-afcf-f7fe691b0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;blockbuster fundraising&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d6c8-dcde-afcf-f7fe691b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">blockbuster fundraising</a> down the stretch and rained down ads on Senate Democratic candidates that helped avert a complete Republican collapse, though the chamber still narrowly flipped. And Democrats expect this year's polls to tighten enough to make every race a nail-biter.</p> <p>“These are all going to be dogfights for the final couple months,” said former Democratic Senate Campaign Committee adviser Justin Barasky. “Republican money is coming. We always knew it was going to, because it always does. Doesn’t mean it’s easy to deal with, but it’s not unexpected.”</p> <p>To an extent, Democrats set their own high expectations off what they see as weak GOP candidates, an improving political climate and a surprisingly productive legislative summer.</p> <p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer channeled those good vibes in an interview earlier this month: “I think we’re going to pick up seats,” he said, adding that voters “see the Republicans as MAGA Republicans, far to the right. And now we’ve shown that we can actually get something done.”</p> <p>Still, with a GOP storm coming in, the Senate Democratic campaign arm is prodding its candidates to keep outpacing their Republican opponents in individual fundraising. Candidates themselves get better ad rates than super PACs, which means Democrats’ best bet to blunt the McConnell-backed group is continued big numbers from senators like Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.).</p> <p>DSCC spokesperson David Bergstein said the committee views this fall's core races as “margin of error” contests, despite polls showing Kelly and Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman up double digits. Bergstein added that the committee knows “each of our battleground races is going to be very competitive, that the spending disparity across the Senate map is going to tighten.”</p> <p>“Republicans have put themselves in an extremely difficult position, heading into the final months of the election, but we're under no delusions that they will have significant resources to spend,” Bergstein said. “We're going to need to be prepared for our campaigns to be able to continue to have an extremely strong paid media presence when this Republican wave of spending comes.”</p> <p>For the moment, Democratic incumbents are holding their own despite President Joe Biden’s low approval ratings in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and New Hampshire. In addition, the party's Senate candidates are threatening to pick up seats in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania while possibly marching even deeper into GOP territory.</p> <p>That happened thanks to Democratic candidates who spent early and often to stay afloat during a choppy last few months, prompting the National Republican Senatorial Committee to spend $42 million. Chris Hartline, a spokesperson for the NRSC, said his organization spent early “to define the Democrats and their radical agenda. Democrats have spent tens of millions in every state on the map, only to be in exactly the same weak position they were in a year ago.”</p> <p>The NRSC now has <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/indexp.php?cycle=2022&amp;cmte=nrsc" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1661461034912,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1661461034912,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/indexp.php?cycle=2022&amp;cmte=nrsc&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d6cb-db61-a1fb-ffcb6fb30001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;$23 million on hand&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d6cb-db61-a1fb-ffcb6fb30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">$23 million on hand</a> after that blitz, about <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/indexp.php?cycle=2022&amp;cmte=dscc" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1661461046984,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1661461046984,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/indexp.php?cycle=2022&amp;cmte=dscc&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d6cb-d289-a3bb-d6ef9db70001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;$30 million less&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d6cb-d289-a3bb-d6ef9db70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">$30 million less</a> than the DSCC.

Ron Johnson is trailing early against Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes. As things stand, GOP groups are slated to slightly outspend Democratic groups this fall in the Badger State.</p> <p>The Schumer-aligned Senate Majority PAC, meanwhile, is also upping its spending as the map gels. The group initially reserved $106 million in the key battlegrounds of Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, then added $27 million in additional reservations.</p> <p>The Schumer-backed PAC also began spending this summer in North Carolina ahead of Republicans’ massive reservation there, though it has not reserved ad time there after Labor Day, according to AdImpact. Veronica Yoo, a spokesperson for Senate Majority PAC, said her group is "committed to making sure that Democrats have the resources" they need.</p> <p>“The fact that Mitch McConnell, the Senate Leadership Fund and their right-wing allies are being forced to shell out tens of millions of dollars on defense is a testament to the strength of our Democratic candidates,” Yoo said.</p> <p>Even the Republican super PAC, which can take unlimited donations, is unable to keep up in Nevada and Arizona, where Democratic groups and candidates currently have reservations outpacing the GOP by a two-to-one margin at the moment. SLF has not yet made a commitment in New Hampshire, giving Democrats an advantage there of more than $10 million.</p> <p>And in Georgia, Democrats have an early spending edge in the race between Warnock and GOP nominee Herschel Walker, a former football star anointed by former President Donald Trump who has struggled on the trail. Warnock had about $15 million more on hand than Walker at the end of the last reporting period, enough for him to spend $3 million per week from his own campaign on ads down the stretch. The McConnell-backed super PAC is spending $5 million a week in Georgia, part of a $39 million fall spending strategy there.</p> <p>Republicans only have to net one seat to win back the Senate, which many in the party say is still achievable even as they grimace over some candidates’ performances. Both parties have also sought to expand the midterm map beyond the core six battleground states; Barasky said GOP-held Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, plus Democratic-held Colorado, will all be fiercely competitive as GOP candidates up their game in the final weeks.</p> <p>“There’s been enough alarms sounded on the Republican side about the money,” Barasky added. “I can only assume they’re going to improve. In a lot of cases, they don’t need to because they can rely on the millions they have in outside money.”</p>]]>

Ryan’s margins even narrowly exceeded President Joe Biden’s performance over Donald Trump’s in the county in 2020, giving him the cushion to withstand drop-off elsewhere in the district and win a bellwether race just months before the general election.</p> <p>Ryan’s victory is the latest in a string of recent signs suggesting that Republicans may not be poised to deliver the shellacking that many expected this fall — and that Democrats, who spent months mired in infighting, off-year election routs and abysmal poll numbers, are getting a jolt of momentum. National generic ballot polling has been slowly trending to the left.

And it's not the first time, right, we saw it happen,” pointing to special elections in Minnesota and Nebraska and a referendum on abortion rights in Kansas.</p> <p>Indeed, Ryan’s win is part of a string of four special elections across three states showing growing suburban enthusiasm for Democrats since the Supreme Court’s <i>Dobbs</i> decision, which undid the national protection of abortion rights previously granted under <i>Roe v. Wade.</i></p> <p>“When we really clearly stand up and fight and say what our principles are and don’t pull our punches, we inspire people, we get people motivated and energized, and we win,” Ryan said in an interview Tuesday with POLITICO.<br></p> <br> <p>Here’s what happened in those four districts — and what they tell us about the shifting political environment.</p> <h3 style="text-align: left">New York</h3> <p>In the closely watched 19th Congressional District, a rare special election in a true swing district, Ryan took home about 51.1 percent of the vote, according to unofficial results as of midday Wednesday. New York continues accepting mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day for seven days after.</p> <p>Ryan’s performance was about 1.5 percentage points ahead of Biden’s 2020 performance in the district, though several points behind former Rep. Antonio Delgado’s margin that year. That jump was driven by high Democratic turnout from voters who also showed up for primary elections for full terms in the newly redrawn 18th and 19th Districts (parts of both are included in the old 19th where the special took place.) In six of the seven counties fully inside the district boundaries, the share of Democratic voters who cast a primary ballot was higher than the share of overall registered voters who voted in the special election — suggesting Democrats turned out at higher rates than Republicans or independents.</p> <p>Republicans insist they are not worried about the loss, blaming it largely on low interest among voters not aligned with a political party, who are likely to turn out at much higher rates in November. These independents — who will determine dozens of swing seats in the fall — had less incentive to participate in a special election held on the same day as New York’s closed party primaries, in which they cannot vote.</p> <p>“Any Democrat celebrating holding a seat they won last cycle by double digits is in for a rough November,” said Michael McAdams, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, referencing Delgado’s 2020 margin. “We will continue to remind voters Democrats are responsible for historic price increases, surging violent crime, and a southern border that has been completely overrun by drug cartels and human smugglers.”</p> <p>The unofficial results show that defeated Republican Marc Molinaro actually received a higher share of the vote than most recent Republican candidates in practically every corner of the district. But the difference was that turnout in its Democratic-friendly portions was far higher.</p> <p>“People are seeing every election matters,” said state Sen. Michelle Hinchey, a Democrat from Ulster. “The decisions over the last few months have really reengaged people and worked them up to what is at stake right now. And it’s not business as usual.”</p> <p>Democrats actually made greater gains compared to 2020 in Western New York’s 23rd District, where Max Della Pia brought in 46.4 percent of the special election vote, according to unofficial results. That’s more than 3 percentage points better than Biden’s performance there two years ago, but not enough to beat out Republican Joseph Sempolinski, who will fill the seat vacated by former GOP Rep. Tom Reed.</p> <p>The biggest gain for Democrats by vote share was in Tompkins County, home of Ithaca, where Della Pia took home 85 percent of the vote compared to 73 percent for Joe Biden two years prior.</p> <h3 style="text-align: left">Minnesota</h3> <p>Ryan’s victory in the special election was the first actual Democratic special election victory this summer, after candidates in Nebraska and Minnesota overperformed Biden’s numbers — but came up short of wins in districts that had been held by Republicans. In southern Minnesota, Democrat Jeff Ettinger ran about 3 percentage points ahead of Biden’s 2020 margin, though that still was not enough to top Brad Finstad, a Republican who filled the seat left open by the late Rep. Jim Hagedorn.</p> <p>While the self-funding Ettinger outspent Finstad, the race attracted only sparse outside spending, all in support of the Republican. That frustrated some Minnesota Democrats who thought they had a chance to flip a rare open seat in the aftermath of the <i>Dobbs v. Jackson </i>decision, said Ken Martin, chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.</p> <p>“The moment that decision came out, you started hearing from people at the doors,” Martin said.</p> <h3 style="text-align: left">Nebraska</h3> <p>In a special election in late June just days after the <i>Dobbs </i>ruling, Democrat Patty Pansing Brooks, a Nebraska state senator, improved nearly five points on Biden’s margin in the state’s deep-red 1st Congressional District, which Trump had won by 11 percentage points. She still came up short against now-Rep. Mike Flood.</p> <p>Pansing Brooks’ biggest gains came in the populous Lancaster County, which contains the state capital of Lincoln. She won 56.6 percent of the vote there in the special election, compared to 52.7 percent for Biden two years prior.</p> <p>In the closing days of the race, Pansing Brooks released a TV ad where she vowed to push back against a “Supreme Court assault on women's rights” — despite the cautions of some her advisers. She attributes her close margin to the shocking ruling and said she wished she had more time for the news to sink in with the electorate before the special election.</p> <p>“I did better than any Democrat since ‘64 in my congressional district,” she said. “I beat Biden by 5 points. I beat the predecessor who ran that was a Democrat by 13. We really felt like the momentum was there.”<br></p>]]>

In New York, where Langworthy has clout and a more moderate wing of the party behind him, it might give her a diminished role, especially when it comes to the selection of a new leader for the state party.</p> <p>It’s not the only blow she took on Tuesday: Stefanik also stumped heavily for Republican Marc Molinaro, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/24/pat-ryan-molinaro-new-york-special-00053458" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;who lost a special election&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/24/pat-ryan-molinaro-new-york-special-00053458&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9bc0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9bc0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">who lost a special election</a> to fill the remainder of a Hudson Valley congressional seat.<br></p> <br> <img src="https://static.politico.com/a4/ae/3241195f42fdaeabe6696945b67d/ap22236179399015.jpg"> <br> <p>In the 23rd district, which covers Buffalo’s suburbs and stretches across much of New York’s Southern Tier border with Pennsylvania, some local leaders were left unhappy by Stefanik’s involvement in the race. Some said it might have backfired with voters ahead of the general election — exposing them to one of the most extreme members of their party.</p> <p>"I was highly disappointed about her position on the race," Dwight “Mike” Healy, the chair of the Allegany County GOP, said. "It wasn’t in the best interest of our district, for sure."</p> <p>One Republican who has been involved in multiple local Republican races said Langworthy’s win was a “black eye” on Stefanik’s leadership because she chose to back a candidate that few of her colleagues in Washington viewed as a stable addition to the delegation.

But she went on to say that Republican candidates are being swamped by Democrats in the chase for campaign cash. The Supreme Court’s June decision nixing <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, McDaniel said, triggered a gusher of online donations for the opposition.</p> <p>McDaniel – who was joined by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the architect of the party’s House takeover in the 1994 midterm election – also said Republican small donors had been “decimated” by the lagging economy. That’s made the GOP more dependent on large contributors, such as those on the call, to compete against Democrats on the air in the final weeks before the election, she said.</p> <p>“We absolutely have better candidates and a better message,” McDaniel said, pushing back on what she described as a false, media-driven narrative that the GOP’s prospects in Senate races are waning. “But,” she said, “we do need financial firepower to drive our effort.”</p> <p>“Newt and I were just talking, in this environment, our candidates can win if they’re outspent two-to-one, but if it gets four, five, six to one, it becomes more difficult, and we’re seeing that specifically on the Senate side. So my call to action today,” McDaniel added, “is to please help us invest in these Senate races specifically. Give to any of these Senate candidates, all of these Senate candidates if you can, so all of them can be on TV.”</p> <p>Republican officials say the RNC hosts such calls every few months to provide updates to major givers. The call comes as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other top Republicans are mobilizing to close the financial gap. McConnell has spent August working the phones to raise money from major donors, according to a person familiar with the conversation.</p> <p>Some senior Republicans have privately grown bearish on the party’s hopes of winning the majority, particularly in light of its growing fundraising woes. An array of candidates in key races — from Arizona’s Blake Masters to Ohio’s J.D. Vance to Pennsylvania’s Mehmet Oz — have found themselves badly outraised by their Democratic opponents. (At one point in the call, an Arizona donor noted that Masters’ rival, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, is flooding the airwaves and made an appeal for other participants to help Masters.)<br></p> <br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6305495296112" frameborder="0"></iframe> <br> <p>Adding to the concern is the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s recent decision to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/15/gop-slashes-ads-in-key-senate-battlegrounds-00051969" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;slash more than $10 million&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/15/gop-slashes-ads-in-key-senate-battlegrounds-00051969&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9bf0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-df98-d9e7-ab9e-ffbbf9bf0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">slash more than $10 million</a> in planned TV ad spending. The Senate GOP campaign arm trails its Democratic counterpart in cash on hand by roughly $31 million, according to the most recent filings.</p> <p>That move has forced the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC closely aligned with McConnell, to fill the void with large investments in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio. During the call, McDaniel said the RNC was creating a joint-fundraising account with 10 state parties to help fund voter turnout programs.</p> <p>The fundraising struggles have fueled broader worries about the strength of the party’s candidates. McConnell last week appeared to lower expectations for a Senate takeover, saying “there’s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate.”</p> <p>“Senate races are just different — they're statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,” said McConnell, adding that after the election “we’re likely to have an extremely close Senate, either our side up slightly or their side up slightly.”</p> <p>During Wednesday’s call, one donor asked Gingrich to respond to McConnell’s remark, prompting the former House speaker to say he “suspects” the GOP leader “regrets having said that,” and that it wasn’t “useful.”</p> <p>But Gingrich also lavished praise on McConnell, saying the Senate GOP leader is working aggressively to help Republican candidates compete financially. Gingrich also noted that McConnell had been “burned” in past election years, when the party fielded candidates “who were, to put it mildly, strange.”</p> <p>“Mitch has always been more cautious, and I’ve always been very optimistic, so you can maybe draw the line in the middle,” said Gingrich, who said he also believes the party’s candidates are strong. </p> <p>During a question-and-answer session, Republican mega-donor Steve Wynn asked whether there are any dark-money nonprofits that contributors could give to. Unlike political action committees, those groups aren’t required to disclose their donors.</p> <p>Some donors, Wynn said, “are self-conscious for reasons that are personal to them, business people and folks like that” and would rather give anonymously.</p> <p>The billionaire also offered up some messaging advice. Republican candidates, he said, should run aggressive TV ads casting Democrats as advocates of tax policies that would hurt lower-wage earners and small businesses.</p> <p>“Hard-hitting kind of spots with a man’s voice, no soft pedal,” Wynn suggested, before giving a sample script: “‘They’re coming after you if you’re a waiter, if you’re a bartender, if you’re anybody with a cash business … they’re coming after you.'”<br></p>]]>

And it suggests that Congress is unwilling to be a bystander in the political and legal fallout following the FBI’s Aug. 8 search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla.</p> <p>It follows a similar request from Senate Intelligence Chair Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Vice Chair Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), two Gang of 8 members who asked the nation’s top intelligence official to draw up an assessment of possible national-security risks related to Trump’s handling of the sensitive documents.<br></p> <br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6310646188112" frameborder="0"></iframe> <br> <p>The Gang of 8 includes the top two congressional leaders in each chamber — Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy — as well as the top Democrat and Republican on the House and Senate intelligence committees.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Senate Intelligence Committee declined to comment. A representative for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence also declined to comment. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for a Gang of 8 member indicated that a specific request hadn’t been signed onto by all eight lawmakers, but acknowledged that congressional oversight is ongoing. (The Gang of 8 and its staff routinely ask the intelligence community for specific information in ways that don’t always require sign-off from all eight members.)</p> <p>Privately, Capitol Hill aides have expressed frustration about the fact that Congress has learned little about the investigation into the former president, especially since it reportedly involves matters of national security. The executive branch has historically resisted congressional inquiries about ongoing law-enforcement actions, arguing that it could compromise the investigation.</p> <p>The FBI search warrant unsealed earlier this month revealed that the Justice Department was investigating potential violations of the Espionage Act, the Presidential Records Act and obstruction of justice in relation to Trump’s storage of White House materials at his home.</p> <p>At a hearing last week in south Florida, the Justice Department’s top counterintelligence official, Jay Bratt, said the investigation is still in its “early stages.”</p> <p>It is possible that the public could learn even more about the probe in the coming days. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, who signed off on the Mar-a-Lago search warrant, has told the Justice Department to propose redactions to the FBI’s affidavit of probable cause that could subsequently be released publicly.</p> <p>A group of media organizations filed a motion asking the judge to unseal the affidavit, citing substantial public interest. Reinhart indicated during last week’s hearing that he was skeptical of the Justice Department’s efforts to keep the affidavit under seal. The document would reveal the government’s justification for requesting Reinhart’s approval of a search warrant.
